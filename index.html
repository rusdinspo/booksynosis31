<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Crossing</h2><p>Six months ago, Harry Bosch left the LAPD before they could fire him, and then hired his half-brother, the maverick Defence Attorney Mickey Haller to sue the department for forcing him out. Although it wasn&#39;t the way he wanted to go, Bosch has to admit that being out of the game has its benefits. Until Mickey asks him to help on one of his cases, and suddenly Harry is back where he belongs, right in the centre of a particularly puzzling murder mystery. The difference is, this time Bosch is working for the defence, aiming to prevent the accused, Da&#39;Quan Foster, from being convicted. And not only does the prosecution seem to have a cast-iron case, but having crossed over to &#39;the dark side&#39; as his former colleagues would put it, Bosch is in danger of betraying the very principles he&#39;s lived by his whole career. With the secret help of his former LAPD partner Lucia Soto, he turns the investigation inside the police department. But as Bosch gets closer to discovering the truth, he makes himself a target.</p><p></p><h2>Crime Science: Methods of Forensic Detection</h2><p>The O.J. Simpson trial. The Lindbergh kidnapping. The death of Marilyn Monroe. The assassination of the Romanovs. The Atlanta child murders. All controversial cases. All investigated with the latest techniques in forensic science. Nationally respected investigators Joe Nickell and John Fischer explain the science behind the criminal investigations that have captured the nation&#39;s attention. Crime Science is the only comprehensive guide to forensics. Without being overly technical or treating scientific techniques superficially, the authors introduce readers to the work of firearms experts, document examiners, fingerprint technicians, medical examiners, and forensic anthropologists. Each topic is treated in a separate chapter, in a clear and understandable style. Nickell and Fisher describe fingerprint classification and autopsies, explain how fibers link victims to their killers, and examine the science underlying DNA profiling and toxicological analysis. From weapons analysis to handwriting samples to shoe and tire impressions, Crime Science outlines the indispensable tools and techniques that investigators use to make sense of a crime scene. Each chapter closes with a study of a well-known case, revealing how the principles of forensic science work in practice.</p><p>&#34;Beautifully organized and ingeniously supplemented by real-life criminal case-histories at the end of each chapter, the book provides a detailed--yet simplified--review of the major methods and techniques of forensic science and criminalistics. Anyone and everyone interested in either real crime or crime-fiction or both, will want to read and regularly refer to this comprehensive and informative source by experts in the field.&#34;--Robert A.

But the spirit which haunts it does not have a name or a body, only a shape: <i>uzumaki</i> the spiral, the hypnotic secret shape of the world. It possessed the father of teenage Kirie's withdrawn boyfriend Shuichi, causing him to remake himself in its image before he died. It grows in ferns, in seashells, in curls of hair, and in the crooked folds of the human brain. Giant snails are sighted near the high school. An eerie glow shines from the abandoned lighthouse. Mosquitoes fly in drowsy curves and feed on blood. As more people are caught in the pattern, over the town of Kur�zu-cho hangs the spiral smoke of cremated corpses; because even in death, there is no escape...</p><p>Junji Ito debuted as a horror manga artist in 1987 with the first story in his successful <i><b>Tomie</b></i> series. <i><b>Uzumaki</b></i>, drawn from 1998 to 1999, was adapted into a live-action movie, which has been released in America by Viz Films and Tidepoint Pictures. It's influences include the classic manga artists Kazuo Umezu and Hideshi Hino, as well as authors Yasutaka Tsutsui and H.P.

On a quiet residential block that should be far removed from the swinging party scene, Detective Sergeant Cathal Breen investigates the murder of a young woman. But the victim, known professionally as Julie Teenager, was a call girl for the rich and famous. Her client list is long, and thick with suspects-all rich, powerful, and protected. As DS Breen hones in on his prime target, he receives a pointed warning: Watch your back. <br>Fortunately, Breen doesn't have to work alone. His keenly intuitive, deeply moral partner Helen Tozer, despite the pregnancy that's interrupted her policing career, can't help being drawn into the case of a girl used and cast aside. <br>Tense and dramatic, unfolding at a blistering pace, <i>Play With Fire</i> is a gripping police thriller set in the darkly technicolor world of the 1960s.</p><p><b>William Shaw</b> is an award-winning music journalist and the author of several non-fiction books including <i>Westsiders: Stories of the Boys in the Hood. </i> Prior to becoming a crime writer, he worked at the post-punk magazine ZigZag and a journalist for The Observer, The New York Times, Wired, Arena, and The Face.

You won't believe what you just read, and won't want to wait to see what's coming next, from the Virgin Mary's Immaculate Contraption to Pericles' greatest erection, the Parthenonon to Custard's Last Stand to Hitler shooting himself in the Bonker and Martin Luther King's ground-breaking speech, "If I Had a Hammer." And who knew: Caesar was assassinated on the Yikes of March, when he is reported to have said, "Me too, Brutus." Rasputin was a pheasant by birth.

Learn about the victims of the Black Death (who "grew boobs on their necks"), the Automaton Empire, Martin Luther King's famous "If I Had a Hammer" speech, the Iran Hostess Crisis, Zorroastrologism (the "duelist" religion "founded by Zorro"), and Joan of Ark, Noah's wife, at rest on Mt. Arafat. Meet Dim El Sum of Korea, the Vestigal Virgins, "dedicated to burning the internal flame," and Hitler, who "shot himself in the bonker." Did you know a position as "lady-in-mating helped a young girl's chances for a marriage," and "the assignation of Archduke Ferdman gave sweet relief to mounting tensions," or that "the major cause of the Civil War is when slavery spread its ugly testicles across the West"?<p> Well, you'd better buckle down and learn, then! <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>The <i>New York Times </i>bestseller is now in an inexpensive paperback edition for Graduation Day mayhem--with a new map and chapter on the Middle East.

There are the births of the great religions: Judyism was the first monolithic religion. It had one big God named 'Yahoo.' The mother of Jesus was Mary, who was different from other women because of her 'Immaculate Contraption.' The Dark Ages, when it was mostly dark. The American civil rights movement, which turned around the corner with Martin Luther Junior's famous 'If I Had a Hammer' speech.

In <i>The Edible Balcony</i>, longtime urban gardener Alex Mitchell shows how to transform whatever space you have, from a balcony or rooftop to a fire escape or window box, into a profusion of fresh, seasonal produce.<br><br>While raising your own produce is eco-friendly in itself, you'll learn how to plant, grow, and water as sustainably as possible to ensure your edible Eden remains green and productive all year long. Plus, with a collection of innovative, step-by-step projects for designing colorful pots and plant supports with recycled containers and other household paraphernalia, you'll double your eco-friendliness, avoid hours of shopping, and be able to infuse your space with your own personal flair and style. Who knew saving time, money, and the environment could be so much fun?<br><br>A collection of practical advice, fabulous container projects, and stunning examples of how gardeners around the world are successfully transforming urban spaces into abundant fruit and vegetable plots, <i>The Edible Balcony</i> is your guide to creating attractive, responsible, and thoroughly rewarding small space gardens&#x2014;and perhaps never having to settle for grocery store produce again.</p><p>Alex Mitchell is a writer and gardener who has grown her own fruits, vegetables, and herbs for ten years. She is a former gardening columnist for the <i>Sunday Telegraph </i>and the author of <i>The Girl's Guide to Growing Your Own, </i>a book for women with busy lives who want to have fun growing produce no matter how small their space<i>.</i> She lives in London.The Easy Edible Balcony<br><br>Many of us dream of growing our own greens, herbs, and tomatoes to eat at home, but worry that we can't spare the time and energy to do it properly. Visions of returning to brown, dry plants after a weekend away instantly come to mind, or fruit and vegetables that never ripen. But if you choose the right crops and follow a few simple growing tips your edible balcony can flourish without making many demands on you at all, even if you are a total beginner. It doesn't take long to set it all up, either; over a weekend you could transform your balcony to an emerging wonderland of shoots and fruits.<br><br>Plants not seeds<br><br>If you don't have the time or the space to raise plants from seed, buy seedlings from garden stores or online suppliers and set up your entire edible balcony over a weekend. Plants ordered from catalogs or Web sites will arrive via the post and can simply be transferred to the potting mix as soon as they arrive. You may not be able to choose from quite the number of varieties available as from seed, but the range is expanding all the time.<br><br>Large containers need less frequent watering than smaller pots.<br><br>Crocks away<br><br>When planting in containers it's traditional to add a layer of "crocks"-- pieces of broken terracotta pots--to the bottom to aid drainage. These are not always easy to source, so you can use chunks of polysytrene packaging instead--the trays that seedlings come in from garden stores are ideal. This material has the added benefit of being really light, too, which is perfect for gardening on balconies.<br><br>Easy peasy: tips for hassle-free balcony gardening<br><br>Big is best<br><br>When choosing containers, make life simple for yourself by not filling your balcony space with numerous tiny pots, as these will dry out the minute you turn your back. Instead, use large, lightweight containers, such as those made of plastic and galvanized metal. Troughs are ideal since they seem to hold their moisture better than round pots and fit snugly around the edge of a balcony, nicely positioned for, say, beans and peas planted in them to grow their way up the railings. Any "patio" planters marketed as being good for growing fruit and vegetables are great for the "no-time" gardener. Light and easy to set up, they can come in bright colors or with attractive woven willow panels to make them look attractive. Plastic bucket trugs are also perfect; they are readily available, cheap, light, and brightly colored, so they will cheer up the dullest of spaces. Do keep in mind that although the container may be light, wet potting mix is not, so check with a structural engineer if you're at all worried about your balcony supporting the weight.<br><br>Self-watering pots<br><br>There's no getting away from it: containers dry out more quickly than garden soil does, and if you're several stories up, the wind won't help this desiccation, but there are ways to take the hassle out of watering. Consider planters with a built-in reservoir--easily available in the stores or simple to make yourself (See Make a Simple, Self-Watering Container for Free, p. 71 )--which can keep even thirsty plants such as zucchini and tomatoes content for several days between waterings.<br><br>Timers of the essence<br><br>If you have easy access to a water supply, a simple automatic watering system is a great help. The most basic version is probably a timer fitted to your outside tap which is connected to a plastic tube with drippers coming off it at intervals of your choosing. This means you can direct these little drippers into your pots. Simply set the timer to come on for five or ten minutes twice a day and your plants won't need you nearly as much.<br><br>Mulch it<br><br>Another way to cut down on watering is to mulch the surface of the potting mix when you first prepare a container. This simply means spreading on a thin layer of well-rotted manure, garden potting mix, shingle, pebbles, or bark chippings so water cannot evaporate as quickly from the potting mix. You can use shredded paper, sheets of newspaper, plastic, or grass clippings too, but shingle is ideal on a balcony or roof since it looks attractive and won't blow away. To get the very best start, water the potting mix well before you first sprinkle the shingle on.<br><br>Crystal clear<br><br>Another handy watering tip, when planting in smaller containers such as hanging baskets, is to mix in a handful of water-retaining gel or crystals. These swell up, absorbing the water, and then slowly release it into the potting mix.<br><br>10 best easy crops<br><br>If you're short on time and expertise, the delicious crops--or groups of crops--listed here are a great place to start. The plants are relatively low-maintenance and their produce truly does taste better than the stuff you can buy in the stores. You can sow these from seed, but for a really easy life buy plug plants from garden stores or online suppliers, plant them straight out into their final growing positions, and leave them to flourish.<br><br>Tomatoes<br><br>However little time you think you have, you have time to grow tomatoes and no summer would be complete without the scent of tomato plants on the air. Grow a pot of basil near them and you can wrap a leaf around a juicy cherry 'Sungold,' then pop the whole package into your mouth, or impress your friends with purply 'Black Krim' or stripy 'Tigerella.'<br><br>From tiny, sweet cherry tomatoes to big, Italian beefsteak varieties, tomatoes come in all shapes and colors. Buy plants in early summer and plant them straight out. Alternatively, grow them from seed in mid-spring, sowing them about 1 in. deep in 3 in. pots on a sunny windowsill, turning the seedlings regularly so they don't grow crooked towards the light. Once all risk of frost has passed, plant them outside in a sunny, sheltered spot away from winds (these plants need the heat to ripen well) and feed them every two weeks from flowering onwards with a high-potash feed such as organic liquid seaweed or an organic tomato feed.<br><br>Easy tip<br><br>When planting tomatoes in a grow bag, don't cut out the whole panel as the instructions tell you to. Instead, cut three crosses in the plastic and then fold the flaps under to make holes to plant in. This means less water can evaporate from the potting mix, helping to cut down on watering.<br><br>3 easy ways...<br><br>There are three types of tomato available (with many varieties of each) and each type is suited to slightly different growing methods. The type you choose depends on what container you want to grow your plants in.<br><br>Bushes need no support and grow only 1 ft. or so high so are best suited to a large window box or pot. A 1 ft.-diameter pot will take one bush, while a large window box should fit two. The advantage is that there's no tying in to supports or pinching out of sideshoots; the disadvantage is that all the tomatoes ripen at once. For bush varieties consider 'Red Alert,' 'Maskotka,' 'Garden Pearl,' or 'Principe Borghese,' which is a mini plum.<br><br>Tumbling forms trail over the edge of containers, so are perhaps best in hanging baskets. Good varieties include the prolific 'Matt's Wild Cherry' and 'Tumbling Tom.'<br><br>Vining tomatoes grow tall, need supports and are best grown in a large pot or growing bag. The tomatoes ripen in stages all summer and right into autumn, so you can get a continuous harvest out of a small space. Good vining varieties include the sweet, orange cherry tomato 'Sungold,' classic red cherry 'Gardener's Delight,' 'Ferline,' and purply 'Black Krim.'<br><br>A 1 ft.-diameter pot will take up to four vining tomatoes grown up a teepee of bamboo canes. Grow bags are an easy option--and if you can find a double- depth bag, so much the better.<br><br>Either buy metal supports or position your bag at the foot of your balcony railings or trellis and tie the plants in as they grow. Pinch out any suckers that form in the joint between the main stem and leaves to channel the plant's energy into fruit production. When the plant has formed six clusters of tomatoes--usually in late summer--pinch out the top of the plant just above a leaf.<br><br>If you don't do this, the plant will keep growing upwards, producing fruit that won't have a chance to ripen before the weather gets colder.<br><br>First or Second Early varieties are best for growing in pots<br><br>Salad potatoes<br><br>There's something magical about tipping out a bucket of potting mix onto the floor and unearthing fresh spud treasure, then boiling it, and eating your crop there and then with melted butter and your own potted mint. Potatoes grown in garden soil tend to be a magnet for slugs and other pests, but those grown up high in a tub, large bucket, or bag show no such signs of damage. They're generally blemish-free and gleaming--needing simply a wash under the kitchen tap to clean off the potting mix.<br><br>Potato leaves provide welcome color in the spring and can soon turn your space into a verdant jungle. Grow Salad or Early varieties such as 'Chieftain,' 'Klondike Rose,' 'Red La Soda,' or 'French Fingerling' to get early new potatoes with an earthy, just-dug flavor. You can really tell the difference.<br><br>Project<br><br>SPUDS IN A TUB<br><br>WHEN TO DO--MID-SPRING<br><br>You will need<br><br>� 1 container at least 1 ft. in diameter--such as a rubber trug, large plastic bucket, pot or bag (not see-through). Avoid very deep pots since the plants need sunlight to develop the tubers. If using a bag, roll the sides down when you plant the tubers, then roll them up as you unearth the growing plants--this ensures the plants always get lots of sunlight <br>� Crocks or polystyrene pieces <br>� Soilless potting mix <br>�&nbsp;Seed potatoes (a 1 ft.-diameter pot takes two potatoes; adjust the quantity depending on the size of your container)<br><br>How to do it<br><br>First make sure your container has drainage holes, then add a layer of crocks on the base. Add about 8 in. of potting mix and place your potatoes, with their shoots facing up, on this, before covering with another 8 in. of potting mix. Water well. If a frost is forecast, place a couple of layers of newspaper on top for protection.<br><br>Keep the potting mix moist and after a few weeks the potato haulms (shoots) will break the surface. When they are about 4 in. high, cover them with more potting mix. Keep covering them each time they're about 4 in. high until they reach the top of the container. Then keep watering and feed every two weeks with a tomato feed or organic liquid seaweed fertilizer. When the potatoes flower it's a sign that the tubers are ready, but have an exploratory dig around before you tip them out; different varieties mature at different times, but First Earlies are worth investigating after about 10 weeks, Second Earlies from about 13 weeks. If you dig carefully you can harvest some potatoes while leaving the others to grow on.<br><br>Bush beans<br><br>A wigwam of climbing pole beans, with their pretty purple or white flowers, heart-shaped leaves, and twining stems, is a lovely sight in any space. Or why not let them climb up your balcony railings, screening your neighbors and creating a jungly wall of beans?<br><br>Beans are wonderfully prolific, particularly the climbing varieties, and are delicious eaten when they're so fresh you can snap them in half. They're ideal for containers as long as they have a sunny, sheltered spot and a nice deep root run, so make sure the pot is at least 8 in. deep (a hanging basket is too shallow). Grow either the bush sort, in which case you'll need no supports, save perhaps a few twiggy sticks, or the climbing pole varieties, which can clamber up a wigwam, trellis, or balcony railing.<br><br>Start sowing bush beans about 2 in. deep from late spring and, if space allows, have at least two containers on the go, resowing the second when the initial batch form their first true leaves. Or sow a new handful of beans every two weeks up to late summer, so that you keep a good supply of beans going right up to mid-autumn. Either sow in small pots inside and transplant them when they're about 4 in. tall, or sow direct into larger containers. A mixed sowing of green, purple, and yellow beans makes a fabulous display when they're growing at full steam. Good pole beans include 'Kentucky Blue Pole,' 'Fortex,' 'Blue Lake,' and 'Purple King.' For bush varieties try 'Beanonza,' 'Tenderpod,' 'Gold Mine,' and 'Purple Queen.'<br><br>Sow bush beans about 6 in. apart and climbing varieties about 4 in. apart around the base of a wigwam or other support they can climb up. Place them in a really warm, sheltered position, keep well watered, and feed every week with a high-potash liquid feed such as seaweed or wormery feed once they start flowering. In the early stages, watch out for slugs and snails.<br><br>Later, beans can attract blackfly, which can be squirted off with a jet of water or sprayed with organic insecticidal soft-soap solution. Pick the beans before the seeds inside start to bulge out of the sides of the pod. Keep picking and the plants will produce more beans.<br><br>Keep picking bush beans and they will produce more pods<br><br>Greens for all seasons<br><br>Greens are perhaps the easiest crops to grow on a balcony, and even a small space should provide you with fresh, springy leaves all summer long. Greens and containers make excellent companions--from large pots to window boxes and hanging baskets. The leaves of greens are shallow-rooted, so they don't mind restricted root space; are fast-growing, so you can pack in several crops a year; and come in a glorious range of colors and textures, so they look as beautiful as any flower-packed alternative. There's something undeniably satisfying about snipping off a few fresh leaves to put in a sandwich or make a quick plate of greens, and you shouldn't be troubled by slugs and snails when growing them up high.<br><br>There's no reason to stop growing greens when summer ends--plenty of lettuce varieties, and other greens, are hardy enough to grow outside over winter. In summer, though, the key with lettuces in small containers is regular watering, since any lettuce under stress will bolt (run to flower and turn bitter) and hanging baskets and window boxes need particular attention to keep from drying out.<br><br>If you'd like mature lettuces, an average 1 ft.-diameter pot will hold around five. The loose-leaved, open varieties work particularly well, brimming over the edges in an irresistible froth. Try mixing burgundy-edged 'Prize Leaf Romaine,' with acid-green 'Simpson Elite,' or oak-leaf varieties, with their pretty, scalloped leaves. Crunchy little lettuces, such as 'Little Caesar,' 'Ez Serve,' and 'Vivian,' are also delicious, their upright habit best suiting a window box or pot.</p><h2>Freedom&#39;s Landing</h2><p>A human slave to the overlords of the Catteni race, Kristin Bjornsen is forced to participate in colonization attempts on a newly discovered planet and is surprised to learn that one of her fellow colonists is a man from her past.</p><p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

A first novel. National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Scott Heim's fiction and poetry have appeared in many literary magazines and anthologies, including the upcoming <i>Best American Gay Fiction.</i> One of the picks in <i>The New York Times Magazine's </i> feature of "Thirty Artists Under Thirty to Watch," he holds degrees from the University of Kansas and Columbia University and lives in New York City."The summer I was eight years old, five hours disappeared from my life"?so runs the catchy opening to Heim's impressive first novel. The speaker is Brian Lackey, now a troubled teenager, once an introverted kid growing up scared in the small town of Hutchinson, Kans. The reason for his memory lapse and his fear, as we and Brian learn during the course of the novel, turns out not to be the space aliens that he first suspects, but his molestation at the hands of his Little League coach. The key to Brian's reclamation of those lost hours is homosexual hustler Neil McCormick?the slugger on that Little League team and an accomplice to Brian's sexual abuse. Working its way over the course of a decade toward Brian and Neil's reunion, the narrative unfolds through chapters whose points of view alternate among Brian, Neil and a handful of their siblings and confidants. Heim makes numerous freshman mistakes, including a relatively static narrative, prominent characters who outlive their usefulness and occasional lapses in the writing. He also creates scenes of genuine beauty, however, and handles his complicated characters and delicate subject matter with calm assurance. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Nursing Home Murder</h2><p>For an unlucky member of parliament, a hospital stay is the unkindest cut of all...<br><br>When Britain's Home Secretary complained of abdominal pains, it seemed like a simple case of appendicitis.

The result is increased poverty and inequality for children. The left argues for more social support for unmarried parents; the right argues for a return to traditional marriage.</p><p>In <i>Generation Unbound</i>, Isabel V. Sawhill offers a third approach: change "drifters" into "planners." In a well-written and accessible survey of the impact of family structure on child well-being, Sawhill contrasts "planners," who are delaying parenthood until after they marry, with "drifters," who are having unplanned children early and outside of marriage. These two distinct patterns are contributing to an emerging class divide and threatening social mobility in the United States.</p><p>Sawhill draws on insights from the new field of behavioral economics, showing that it is possible, by changing the default, to move from a culture that accepts a high number of unplanned pregnancies to a culture in which adults only have children when they are ready to be a parent.</p><br></p><p>Over half of all births to young adults in the United States today occur outside of marriage, and most are unplanned. This trend is driving a growing class divide. At the top are &#x201c;planners,&#x201d; who are marrying and having children only after establishing a career. At the bottom&#x2015;and increasingly in the middle&#x2015;are &#x201c;drifters,&#x201d; who are having unplanned children early, outside of marriage, and without the stable support of a second parent. This divide is contributing to rising inequality and decreased social mobility for both young parents and<br>their children.<p></p><p>The political right calls for a return to traditional marriage; the left proposes more social programs to help less advantaged families. In<br><i>Generation Unbound</i>, Isabel V. Sawhill offers a provocative third approach: turning &#x201c;drifters&#x201d; into &#x201c;planners&#x201d; and thereby ensuring that more<br>children are born into families with the means and motivation to care for them&#x2015;and saving billions of dollars in social costs.</p><p>How do we make this shift? Drawing on behavioral economics, Sawhill offers recommendations for preventing unplanned pregnancy among young adults&#x2015;for example, by offering greater access to long-acting reversible contraception (such as IUDs) to help<br>stem the tide of children born to parents who are unprepared for the financial and social responsibilities of raising a child.</p><p><b>Isabel V.

Provides historical information, detailed item descriptions, and values for a wide variety of desk accessories -- a category not covered in other books focused on writing implements.</p><p>It's not just what you write, it's what you write it with. In a world where e-mailing and word processing are the new norm, nostalgia for fountain pens, inkwells, and other erstwhile desk accessories is on the rise. What's more satisfactory--signing a letter with a Bic or a black rubber gold-nibbed 1950s Parker Duofold? For lovers of pen and ink, <i>The Write Stuff</i> is an informative book on the history of ink and ink containers, pen making, and collecting.<p> Filled with black-and-white photographs and illustrated advertisements (plus a 31-page full-color section), <i>The Write Stuff</i> takes us through the advent of the writing trade up to the rediscovery of the fountain pen in the 1980s. Beginning with Egyptian scribes and lasting until the Middle Ages, inkwells were plain and serviceable and pens made from reeds or feathers. With the Renaissance, inkwells became ornate and were often made of precious metals or delicate porcelain (for the most part, only the wealthy could read and write). The steel pen debuted in the mid-1700s, and not until the 20th century did fountain pens, which are now sought-after collectibles, appear. Inkwells and desk accessories are often of more value than fountain pens, but the pens invoke a fond sentiment for less-hurried times--and these days, represent style, prestige, and power. </p><p> Written by Ray and Bevy Jaegers, longtime pen and inkwell collectors, <i>The Write Stuff</i> tends to focus more on the history of the inkwells, pens, and their makers than on how to collect or on the going rate for these collectibles. But they do make you want to push that keyboard aside and reach for a thick sheet of combed cotton paper, a cut crystal inkwell, and a white goose quill. <i>--Dana Van Nest</i></p></p><h2>Fantastic Four, Vol. 2, Nos. 21-40 (Marvel Essentials)</h2><p>Four friends braved the unknown dangers of space together in search of the secrets of the universe!

Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, the little girl is as good as gone until she is discovered by a group who call themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the "Others." Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. She painstakingly nurses her back to health--a decision that will forever alter the physical and emotional structure of the clan. Although this story takes place roughly 35,000 years ago, its cast of characters could easily slide into any modern tale. The members of the Neanderthal clan, ruled by traditions and taboos, find themselves challenged by this outsider, who represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.<p> Although Jean Auel obviously takes certain liberties with the actions and motivations of all our ancestors, her extensive research into the Ice Age does shine through--especially in the detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla. Mostly, though, this first in the series of four is a wonderful story of survival. Ayla's personal evolution is a compelling and relevant tale. <i>--Sara Nickerson</i></p>The stunning epic that stirred the imagination of millions. Here is a novel of awesome beauty and power. A moving saga about people, relationships and the boundaries of love. Through Jean Auel&#39;s magnificent storytelling, we are taken back to the dawn of mankind and swept up in the wonderful world of a very special heroine, Ayla. Her enthralling story is one we all can share. A natural disaster has left young Ayla alone, wandering, fending for herself in an unfamiliar land. One day, she is discovered by the Clan of the Cave bear, men and women far different from her own people. Tall, blond, blue-eyed Ayla is a mysterious stranger to the Clan and at first they mistrust her and cast her out. But as she grows to know them and to learn the ways of the Clan, she is welcomed. And as she leads them in their struggle for survival, the Clan come to worship Ayla.

Apart from that, I&#39;ve edited a few books on the nineteenth century popular novel, my reviews and articles appear in supplements and journals throughout Europe, and I organize summer school courses on contemporary writers&#39; [p. 5]. What is unusual about the way Balkan introduces himself? Does his description of himself reflect his actions in the novel? 2. Corso is frequently described as resembling a wolf or a rabbit. Is either description an accurate depiction of his personality? Does Corso&#39;s character undergo a transformation by the end of the novel? And if so, what causes it? 3. Is Balkan a reliable narrator? How do you account for his detailed knowledge of Corso&#39;s activities? Why did Arturo P�rez-Reverte choose to use Balkan as a narrator? Is Corso also a narrator of the story? Who is in control of the narrative? 4. When Corso visits Varo Borja at the beginning of the novel he hears a &#39;jarring sound, warning him. . . . He was no longer sure he wanted the job&#39; [p. 51]. Why does Corso take the job despite his reservations? How do his feelings about books differ from Varo Borja&#39;s or Boris Balkan&#39;s? 5. Corso immediately notices Liana Taillefer&#39;s resemblance to Kim Novak, the actress who portrayed a beautiful witch in the 1958 film Bell, Book, and Candle . Does Corso use a literary and cinematic lens to view the other women he encounters in the book? How does he see Irene Adler? 6. What do the rooms in which Liana Taillefer, Boris Balkan, Corso, Varo Borja, and Victor Fargas live say about each of them? Are the rooms in any way deceptive? With what settings do you associate Irene Adler? What does the home address she gives say about her? 7. Balkan is very opinionated when it comes to the kind of writing he deems worthwhile [see pages 5, 98, 313, and 322]. Do you think Balkan would consider The Club Dumas a worthwhile piece of literature? Why? 8. The Club Dumas does not establish a precise time period. What era do you imagine The Club Dumas to take place? Do certain characters seem to exist in their own historical periods? If so, how does this effect the way characters construct their identities and how they perceive one another? 9. What are the sources of evil in the novel? Is P�rez-Reverte&#39;s interest in the presence of evil in modern history conveyed in his depiction of Varo Borja&#39;s desire to raise the devil through magic? Is Borja naive in believing that summoning the devil requires secret knowledge? 10. To what extent do the engravings in The Book of the Nine Doors to the Kingdom of Darkness illustrate Corso&#39;s quest for the truth about the two books he is trying to authenticate? What do you think engraving number VII, of a king and a servant playing chess, might represent in terms of Corso&#39;s adventure? And how does engraving number IX, of a woman riding a seven-headed dragon, illuminate Corso&#39;s discoveries? 11. Who is Irene Adler? Do you accept her explanation of her identity? How does the identity she constructs affect your understanding of the opposition of God and the devil in the novel? 12. Balkan tells Corso that &#39;games are the only universally serious activity&#39; [p.314]. How does Balkan&#39;s attitude to &#39;the game&#39; compare with that of Corso, Liana Taillefer, and Irene Adler? Does anyone win the game? Has Corso&#39;s attitude to the game changed by the end of the book? 13. Boris Balkan argues that he never led Corso to believe that there was a connection between &#39;The Anjou Wine&#39; and The Nine Doors : &#39;It was you who filled in the blanks on your own, as if what happened were a novel based on trickery, with Lucas Corso the reader too clever for his own good. Nobody ever told you that things were actually as you thought. No, the responsibility is entirely yours, my friend. The real villain of the piece is your excessive intertextual reading and linking of literary references&#39; [p. 334]. Is Balkan right? To what extent are Balkan and Corso responsible for the violence that occurs in the story? 14. Is the Club Dumas justified in its mission to protect the reputation of Alexandre Dumas by withholding evidence about his collaboration with his assistant Auguste Moquet? Why does Balkan care so much about Dumas&#39;s reputation? Does Balkan&#39;s attitude toward Dumas influence your opinion of Balkan? 15. Corso and Balkan argue about whether children and young people raised watching television have the &#39;spiritual heritage&#39; they themselves received from books and old movies [p. 325]. Could The Club Dumas have been written about television devotees? How would the characters and plot differ? 16. Corso recalls Nikon telling him, &#39;Films are for everyone, collective, generous. . . . They&#39;re even better on TV: two can watch and comment. But your books are selfish. Solitary. . . . A person who is interested in books doesn&#39;t need other people and that frightens me&#39; [p. 210]. Is Corso a frightening person because of his obsession with books? What about the other characters who share a passion for books? Is it significant that Irene Adler reads cheap paperbacks [p. 138]? Why doesn&#39;t Corso want to join the Club Dumas party?</p><p>PRAISE FOR THE CLUB DUMAS<br>"An intelligent and delightful novel." -THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW <br>"A cross between Umberto Eco and Anne Rice . . .

Lila is a superb creation. Largely uneducated, almost feral, Lila has a thirst for stability and knowledge. As she yearns to forget the terrible memories and shame of her past, Lila is hesitant to reveal them to her loving new husband. The courtship of the couple--John Ames: tentative, shy, and awkward; Lila: naive, suspicious, wary, full of dread--will endure as a classic set piece of character revelation, during which two achingly lonely people discover the comfort of marital love . . . Robinson carefully crafts this provocative and deeply meaningful spiritual search for the meaning of existence. What brings the couple together is a joyous appreciation of the beauty of the natural world and the possibility of grace." --"Publishers Weekly<br><br>"*Starred Review* "Robinson has created a tour de force, an unforgettably dynamic odyssey, a passionate and learned moral and spiritual inquiry, a paean to the earth, and a witty and transcendent love story--all within a refulgent and resounding novel so beautifully precise and cadenced it wholly tranfixes and transforms us." --Donna Seaman, "Booklist"<br>Praise for "Home" and "Gilead<br><br>""An anguished pastoral, a tableau of decency and compassion that is also an angry and devastating indictment of moral cowardice and unrepentant, unacknowledged sin . . .

In fact, Dee had an interaction with her own young son that convinced her of this. Curious about this phenomenon, Wayne and Dee decided to issue an invitation to parents all over the world to share their experiences. The overwhelming response they received prompted them to put together this book, which includes the most interesting and illuminating of these stories in which very young children speak about their remembrances before they were born.<br><br> It seems that infants and toddlers often arrive here with memories of their lifetimes in the spirit world and frequently provide evidence of this to their immediate families. They tell of dialogues with God, give evidence that they themselves had a hand in picking their own parents, speak about long-deceased family members they knew while in the dimension of Spirit, verify past-life recollections, and speak eloquently and accurately of a kind of Divine love that exists beyond this physical realm&#x2014;and even of times when telepathic communication took place, as well as the ability to decide just when they would come here to Earth.<br><br> This fascinating book encourages parents and grandparents to take a much more active role in communicating with their new arrivals . . . and to realize that there is far more to this earthly experience than what we perceive with our five senses.</p><p><p>Affectionately called the &#x201c;father of motivation&#x201d; by his fans,&nbsp;<b>Dr. Wayne W.

Guy Cogeval, the director of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, and three curators at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Mus�e d&#39;Orsay in Paris, and the Royal Academy of Arts in London (the exhibition will appear at all four museums) have authored the substantial catalogue entries as well as essays on the painter&#39;s life and career. Like the exhibition, the catalogue provides exhaustive coverage of Vuillard&#39;s oeuvre, featuring paintings, prints, and many photographs he took of his friends, family, colleagues, and models. The catalogue is copublished with Yale U. Press (their ISBN is 0-300- 09737-9). Annotation (c) Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>A quiet man who lived with his beloved mother, the painter �douard Vuillard applied his inventive talents to re-imagining bourgeois interiors as shifting planes of color and pattern. Admirers of his sensuous interior world will be bowled over by this sumptuous volume with its vivid narrative and 463 exquisite color reproductions. In <i>�douard Vuillard</i>, Guy Cogeval discusses the artist's life and work with a passionate involvement that is rare in contemporary art writing. He describes how Vuillard's early work as a set designer apparently led him to stage manage family members, placing them in tense or confrontational tableaux that he memorialized in paint. Vuillard was an enthusiastic amateur photographer who favored the new handheld Kodak camera. An entire chapter is dedicated to the artist's charmingly artless snapshots of family and friends. In his later years, Vuillard utilized a more down-to-earth painting style in portraits of the rich and famous. While these paintings are often dismissed as conservative, Cogeval points out Vuillard's use of subtle details to comment on some of his sitters. Four other essayists treat themes ranging from "Vuillard and Ambiguity" to the effect of his annual summer vacations on his treatment of landscape, light and composition. This exceptional book accompanies an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, in Washington, D.C., from Jan. 19 to April 20, 2004, which travels to Montreal, Paris, and London. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>Published in association with the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal</p><h2>The Art &amp; Craft of Novel Writing</h2><p>Covers historical research, point of view, characterization, plot, style, dialog, and dramatization, and discusses the writing process</p><p></p><h2>Blythe Style</h2><p>International superstar and high fashion model Blythe has never let the fact that she is literally a doll slow her down.

That was his greatest curse and his eternal punishment.<p>He ran his tongue over his teeth, wishing it were a blade over his enemy's throat instead. Most of the day had already passed. He'd heard the time seep away, a poisonous tick-tock in his mind, every beat of the clock a mocking reminder of mortality and pain.</p><p>In little more than an hour, the first sting would pierce his stomach and nothing he did, nothing he said, would change that. Death would come for him.</p><p>"Damned gods," he muttered, increasing the speed of his bench presses.</p><p>"Bastards, every one of them," a familiar male voice said from behind him.</p><p>Maddox's motions didn't slow at Torin's unwelcome intrusion. Up. Down. Up. Down. For two hours he had worked out his frustration and anger on the punching bag, the treadmill and now the weights. Sweat ran from his bare chest and arms, riding the ropes of his muscles in clear rivulets. He should be as exhausted mentally as he was physically, but his emotions were only growing darker, more powerful. </p><p>"You should not be here," he said.</p><p>Torin sighed. "Look. I didn't mean to interrupt, but something's happened."</p><p>"So take care of it."</p><p>"I can't."</p><p>"Whatever it is, try. I'm in no shape to help." These last few weeks very little was needed to send him into a killing haze where no one around him was safe. Even his friends. Especially his friends. He didn't want to, never meant to, but was sometimes helpless against urges to strike and to maim.</p><p>"Maddox&#x2014;"</p><p>"I'm at the edge, Torin," he croaked. "I would do more harm than good."</p><p>Maddox knew his limitations, had known them for thousands of years. Ever since that doomed day the gods had chosen a woman to perform a task that should have been his.</p><p>Pandora had been strong, yes, the strongest female soldier of their time. But he had been stronger. More capable. Yet he had been deemed too weak to guard dimOuniak, a sacred box housing demons so vile, so destructive, they could not even be trusted in Hell.</p><p>As if Maddox would have allowed it to be destroyed. Frustration had bloomed inside him at the affront. Inside all of them, every warrior now living here. They had fought diligently for the king of the gods, killed expertly and protected thoroughly; they should have been chosen as guards. That they hadn't was an embarrassment not to be tolerated.</p><p>They'd only thought to teach the gods a lesson the night they'd stolen dimOuniak from Pandora and released that horde of demons upon the unsuspecting world. How foolish they had been. Their plan to prove their power had failed, for the box had gone missing in the fray, leaving the warriors unable to recapture a single evil spirit.</p><p>Destruction and havoc had soon reigned, plunging the world into darkness until the king of the gods finally intervened, cursing each warrior to house a demon inside himself.</p><p>A fitting punishment. The warriors had unleashed the evil to avenge their stinging pride; now they would contain it.</p><p>And so the Lords of the Underworld were born. </p><p>Maddox had been given Violence, the demon who was now as much a part of him as his lungs or his heart. Now, man could no longer live without demon and demon could no longer function without man. They were woven together, two halves of a whole.</p><p>From the very first, the creature inside him had beckoned him to do malicious things, hated things, and he'd been compelled to obey. Even when led to slay a woman&#x2014;to slay Pandora. His fingers clenched the bar so tightly his knuckles nearly snapped out of place. Over the years he had learned to control some of the demon's more vile compulsions, but it was a constant struggle and he knew he could shatter at any moment.</p><p>What he would have given for a single day of calm. No overpowering desire to hurt others. No battles within himself. No worries. No death. Just...peace.</p><p>"It's not safe for you here," he told his friend, who still stood in the doorway. "You need to leave." He set the silver bar atop its perch and sat up. "Only Lucien and Reyes are allowed to be close to me during my demise." And only because they played a part in it, unwilling though they were. They were as helpless against their demons as Maddox was his.</p><p>"About an hour until that happens, so..." Torin threw a rag at him. "I'll take my chances."</p><p>Maddox reached behind his back, caught the white cloth and turned. He wiped his face. "Water."</p><p>An ice-cold bottle was soaring through the air before the second syllable left his mouth. He caught it deftly, moisture splashing his chest. He drained the icy contents and studied his friend.</p><p>As usual, Torin wore all black and gloves covered his hands. Pale hair fell in waves to his shoulders, framing a face mortal females considered a sensual feast. They didn't know the man was actually a devil in angel's skin. They should have, though. He practically glowed with irreverence, and there was an unholy gleam in his green eyes that proclaimed he would laugh in your face while cutting out your heart. Or laugh in your face while you cut out his heart.</p><p>To survive, he had to find humor where he could. They all did.</p><p>Like every resident of this Budapest fortress, Torin was damned. He might not die every night like Maddox, but he could never touch a living thing, skin to skin, without infecting it with sickness.</p><p>Torin was possessed by the spirit of Disease. </p><p>He hadn't known a woman's touch in over four hundred years. He'd learned his lesson well when he'd given in to lust and caressed a would-be lover's face, bringing about a plague that decimated village after village. Human after human.</p><p>"Five minutes of your time," Torin said, his determination clear. "That's all I'm asking."</p><p>"Think we'll be punished for insulting the gods today?" Maddox replied, ignoring the request. If he didn't allow himself to be asked for a favor, he didn't have to feel guilty for turning it down.</p><p>His friend uttered another of those sighs. "Our every breath is supposed to be a punishment."</p><p>True. Maddox's lips curled into a slow, razored smile as he peered ceilingward. Bastards. Punish me further, I dare you. Maybe then, finally, he would fade to nothingness.</p><p>He doubted the gods would concern themselves, though. After bestowing the death-curse upon him, they had ignored him, pretending not to hear his pleas for forgiveness and absolution. Pretending not to hear his promises and desperate bargaining.</p><p>What more could they do to him, anyway?</p><p>Nothing could be worse than dying over and over again. Or being stripped of anything good and right...or hosting the spirit of Violence inside his mind and body.</p><p>Jackknifing to his feet, Maddox tossed the now-wet rag and empty water bottle into the nearest hamper. He strode to the far end of the room and braced his hands above his head, leaning into the semicircular alcove of stained-glass windows and staring into the night through the only clear partition.</p><p>He saw Paradise.</p><p>He saw hell.</p><p>He saw freedom, prison, everything and nothing.</p><p>He saw...home.</p><p>Situated atop a towering hill as the fortress was, he had a direct view of the city. Lights glowed brightly, pinks, blues and purples illuminating the murky velvet sky, glinting off the Danube River and framing the snowcapped trees that dominated the area. Wind blustered, snowflakes dancing and twirling through the air.</p><p>Here, he and the others had a modicum of privacy from the rest of the world. Here, they were allowed to come and go without having to face a barrage of questions. Why don't you age? Why do screams echo through the forest every night? Why do you sometimes look like a monster?</p><p>Here, the locals maintained their distance, awed, respectful. "Angels," he'd even heard whispered during a rare encounter with a mortal.</p><p>If they only knew.</p><p>Maddox's nails elongated slightly, digging into the stone. Budapest was a place of majestic beauty, old-world charm and modern pleasures, but he'd always felt removed from it. From the castle district that lined one street to the nightclubs that lined the next. From the fruits and vegetables hawked in one alley to the living flesh hawked in the other.</p><p>Maybe that sense of disconnection would vanish if he ever explored the city, but unlike the others who roamed at will, he was trapped inside the fortress and surrounding land as surely as Violence had been trapped inside Pandora's box thousands of years ago.</p><p>His nails lengthened farther, almost claws now. Thinking of the box always blackened his mood. Punch a wall, Violence beckoned. Destroy something. Hurt, kill. He would have liked to obliterate the gods. One by one. Decapitate them, perhaps. Rip out their blackened, decayed hearts, definitely.</p><p>The demon purred in approval.</p><p>Of course it's purring now, Maddox thought with disgust. Anything bloodthirsty, no matter the victims, met with the creature's support. Scowling, he leveled another heated glance at the heavens. He and the demon had been paired long ago, but he remembered the day clearly. The screams of the innocent in his ears, humans bleeding all around him, hurting, dying, the spirits having devoured their flesh in a rapturous frenzy.</p><p>Only when Violence had been shoved inside his body did he lose touch with reality. There had been no sounds, no sights. Just an all-consuming darkness. He hadn't regained his senses until Pandora's blood splattered his chest, her last breath echoing in his ears.</p><p>She had not been his first kill&#x2014;or his last&#x2014;but she had been the first and only woman to meet his sword. The horror of seeing that once-vibrant female form broken and knowing he was responsible for it... To this day, he had not assuaged the guilt, the regret. The shame and the sorrow.</p><p>He'd sworn to do whatever was necessary to control the spirit from then on, but it had been too late. Enraged all the more, Zeus had bestowed a second curse upon him: every night at midnight he would die exactly as Pandora had died&#x2014;a blade through the stomach, six hellish times. The only difference was, her torment had ended within minutes.</p><p>His ...</p></p><h2>Faust in Copenhagen: A Struggle for the Soul of Physics</h2><p>Documents the 1932 gathering of some forty of the world&#39;s top names in physics, placing the meeting against a backdrop of key scientific developments while citing the contributions of specific figures and offering insight into how their unsuspecting collaborations gave way to subsequent historical events.</p><p><b>Gino Segrè</b> is professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania. An internationally renowned expert on high-energy elementary-particle theoretical physics, he is the author of <i>A Matter of Degrees: What Temperature Reveals About the Past and Future of Our Species, Planet, and Universe</i>. He has received awards from the National Science Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, and the U.S. Department of Energy.<i>Starred Review.</i> Segr� (<i>A Matter of Degrees</i>) once again applies a human scale to important physics topics in a way that's as informative and accessible as it is appealing. Beginning in 1929, Niels Bohr hosted an annual gathering in Copenhagen for his fellow physicists, where they joked and argued about the new theory of quantum mechanics. Tradition demanded that the younger physicists entertain with a skit, and in 1932, the centenary of Goethe's death, the entertainment was Max Delbr�ck's parody of <i>Faust</i>, with the proponents of classical physics and the new quantum mechanics fighting for primacy. The discovery of the neutron and the positron had disturbed classical atomic theory, while quantum mechanics raised troubling issues, such as how one could find the true position of an electron and how the photon could be both a particle and a wave. Segr� brings the scientists and their ideas to vivid life, from convivial Bohr and iconoclastic Wolfgang Pauli (nicknamed "Scourge of God"), to emotionally guarded Werner Heisenberg, gracious Lise Meitner, reclusive Paul Dirac and others, as well as the consequences of their discoveries. For after 1932 came Hitler and WWII, and a new physics that could never be as intimate, or as innocent, as it had once been. <i>(June 18)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It takes dedication and discipline to be the best, and the Shohoku High hoops team wants to be just that--the best. They have one last year to make their captain's dream of reaching the finals come true--will they do it? Takehiko Inoue's legendary basketball manga is finally here, and the tale of a lifetime is in your hands!<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Sakuragi Hanamichi's got no game with girls--none at all! It doesn't help that he's known for throwing down at a moment's notice and always coming out on top. A hopeless bruiser, he's been rejected by 50 girls in a row! All that changes when he meets the girl of his dreams, Haruko, and she's actually not afraid of him! When she introduces him to the game of basketball, his life is changed forever...</p><p>Takehiko Inoue was born in Kagoshima prefecture in 1967. His first major success -- the hugely popular 31-volume long basketball manga SLAM DUNK -- sold over 100 million copies worldwide and catapulted him into the top ranks of Japanese manga artists. Besides manga, Inoue also worked on character design for the Playstation basketball game ONE ON ONE.Although Inoue's imported teen sport-romance manga <i>Slam Dunk</i>&#x2014;a big hit back in Japan&#x2014;is ostensibly about the love of basketball, it really starts out as a chronicle of love and rejection in high school. The series' towering, red-haired hero, Hanamichi Sakuragi, is first shown in utter dejection, after having been rejected by 50 girls in a row (apparently, people are keeping count). But saving him from utter despair is the appearance of the angelic Haruko Akagi, who flirtatiously swoons over his stature and wonders whether or not he plays basketball. After some gentle considerations of whether he's interested (If only I could walk her to school!! Then I could die happy) Hanamichi sets about trying to get on the basketball team. Haruko disappears from the pages not long after she has conveniently set the plot device in motion, leaving Inoue free to depict Hanamichi's attempts be accepted by the arrogant upperclassmen who dominate the team. It comes as a disappointment to Hanamichi&#x2014;a hot-tempered kid who prefers to pick fights and slam dunk than learn how to actually play the game,&#x2014;that winning Haruko's heart is going to take some work. Inoue's pacing is frantic, if somewhat padded, but he manages to maintain a welcome sense of humor amid all the adolescent gamesmanship. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It emphasizes word roots and earliest meanings, making it an indispensable companion to standard maritime dictionaries. The author steers his way through a potentially dry subject with a witty flair that will please as well as inform. The mariner&#39;s language is almost universal in its usage and its sources. An idle curiosity about the derivation of the term &#34;&#34;peajacket&#34;&#34; led John G. Rogers to devour ancient and modern texts in his six-year search for the origins of sea terms. While light-hearted in its presentation, ORIGINS OF SEA TERMS is serious in intent. It contains 1,248 entries pertaining to life on board ship, hulls and rigging, ship handling, sea and weather conditions, and naval and technical terms. ORIGINS OF SEA TERMS is volume XI in Mystic Seaport Museum&#39;s American Maritime Library.&#34;</p><p>John G. Rogers was indoctrinated in the correct use of sea language as a boy sailing with his father, brother, and friends at Nonquitt on Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. As a young sailor he graduated from Herreshoff 12 1/2s to cruising yachts, including crew experience on an Alden schooner. After leaving Harvard College in 1936 he got his sea legs in six Matson Line ships in the Pacific. During World War II he served in the Pacific aboard the destroyer escort Stadtfeld, logging 100,000 miles and returning as a lieutenant commander. After the war he became a stockbroker in San Francisco with E. F. Hutton and Company, and pursued his interest in yachts and small boats with a Hinckley Owens cutter and with the tugboat Beaver, kept in Sausalito as a weekend retreat. Before his death in 1992 John Rogers served as trustee of the National Maritime Museum Association and as curator of the St. Francis Yacht Club.</p><h2>The Shortest Day: Celebrating the Winter Solstice</h2><p>The beginning of winter is marked by the solstice, the shortest day of the year. Long ago, people grew afraid when each day had fewer hours of sunshine than the day before. Over time, they realized that one day each year the sun started moving toward them again. In lyrical prose and cozy illustrations, this book explains what the winter solstice is and how it has been observed by various cultures throughout history. Many contemporary holiday traditions were borrowed from ancient solstice celebrations. Simple science activities, ideas for celebrating the day in school and at home, and a further-reading list are included. <br><br> Illustrated by Jesse Reisch.</p><p>Wendy Pfeffer is the author of many science-oriented children's books, including <i>From Tadpole to Frog</i> and <i>A Log's Life</i>, which won the Giverny Award for Best Children's Science Picture Book.<b>Praise for The Shortest Day:</b><br><br>"In a well-thought-out collection of ideas surrounding December 21 and the Winter Solstice, the author leads readers through what happens to the sun and why... Back pages include an interesting and useful variety of ideas, from more facts about the solstice with explanatory diagrams, four projects that teachers, parents, and adults who work with children would find fresh, and two "cooking" activities, one for a human party and one for an avian one."<br>&#x2014;Children's Literature<br><br>"Using clear, concise language, Pfeffer discusses important ideas behind the shortest day of the year, such as the change from autumn to winter as well as the concept of the Earth's tilting away from the sun. The historical view provides a brief look at the days of prehistoric sun worship as well as chronological interpretations of the phenomenon from 5000 to 1000 years ago. Thus, young listeners are exposed to the ideas of ancient Egyptian, Chinese, Incan, and European astronomers and their efforts to explain this scientific wonder. The modern scene of the solstice celebration, though obviously at Christmas, features family, presents, and stockings on the mantle but has no religious overtones. The remaining pages feature more complete "Solstice Facts," four simple experiments, two party suggestions, and a short but up-to-date list for further reading. While appealing to a younger audience, this treatment combines the cultural approach of Ellen Jackson's The Winter Solstice (Millbrook, 1994) and the activities of Sandra Markle's Exploring Winter (Atheneum, 1984; o.p.). Pfeffer uses an easy, comfortable tone for conveying the basic information, and the end pages will provide additional opportunities for would-be astronomers to explore the principles on their own."<br>&#x2014;School Library Journal</p><h2>Zen&#39;s Chinese Heritage: The Masters and Their Teachings</h2><p><i>Zen's Chinese Heritage</i> traces twenty-five generations of inlightened Buddhist teachers, supplementing their core teachings with history, biography, and poetry. The result is an intimate and profound human portrait of the enlightened Zen ancients, and an unprecedented look into the depths of the rich cultural heritage.<br> <br>In this new edition with even more valuable material, Ferguson surveys generations of Zen masters, moving chronologically through successive generations of ancestral teachers, supplementing their core teachings with history, biography, and starkly beautiful poetry. In addition to giving the reader the engaging sense of the "family history" of Zen, this uniquely valuable book paints a clear picture of the tradition's evolution as a religious, literary, and historical force.</p><p>The history of Zen can be almost as perplexing as its cryptic koan. In many accounts of Zen history, it is hard to tell who is Chinese and who is Japanese, who lived in the 6th century and who in the 16th. Andy Ferguson attempts to clear the air once and for all. In <i>Zen's Chinese Heritage</i>, he organizes all of the Chinese Zen masters from Bodhidharma at the turn of the 5th century to Huikai in the 13th century, presenting their core records and writings in chronological order by generation--25 generations in all. Drawing from <i>Wudeng Huiyan</i> (<i>Compendium of Five Lamps</i>) and other records, Ferguson translates the classic Zen teachings (including dialogues, anecdotes, and koan) in spare, straightforward language. He also presents an expertly arranged foldout lineage chart of the Zen ancestors, with cross-referencing by Japanese, Chinese <i>pinyin</i>, and Chinese Wade-Giles transcriptions. Ferguson's work is not only a priceless treasury of Zen literature but also a road map to the history of Zen. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Reb Anderson Roshi moved to San Francisco in 1967 to study Zen Buddhism with Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, who ordained him as a priest in 1970.

When The Murder at the Vicarage was published in October 1930, little did the literary world realise that Agatha Christie, already famous for her early Poirot titles, was introducing a character who would become the best-loved female sleuth of all time. The 14 Marple books would appear at intervals over the next 49 years, with Miss Marple&#39;s Final Cases published in 1979, three years after Agatha&#39;s death. To mark the 75th anniversary of Miss Marple&#39;s first appearance, and to celebrate her renewed fortunes as a primetime television star, this collection of facsimile first editions will be the perfect way to enjoy these books in their original form -- 12 novels and two short story collections.

Chester insists something terrible is about to happen. And he&#39;s right. The Monroes are going on vacation--and the animals are going to Chateau Bow-Wow...known to them as Howliday Inn. This visit turns out to be even worse than the last harrowing experience--with a whole new cast of characters: a very sad Great Dane, a pair of worried yuppie puppies, and two sinister sisters who pride themselves as cat burglars.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Part of the Girls of Many Lands series, this colorful novel introduces the spirited 12-year-old Chou Spring Pearl against the backdrop of Canton, China, during the Opium War of 1857. The recently orphaned girl has been liberally raised by her artist parents she can read and write and speak English but now she's a charity case, taken in by Master Sung, a wealthy friend of her father's. Life with Sung's arrogant wife and daughters (who call her "Miss Ratty" after her poor ghetto neighborhood) starts off rocky, but Spring Pearl rises to the challenge through strength of character, gradually earning the respect of the entire household. When Master Sung is arrested and imprisoned, Spring Pearl's courage and ingenuity help bring the family safely through the ordeal. Spring Pearl has a bit of both Cinderella (she's assigned menial chores at first) and Mary Lenox (she restores the Sungs' neglected garden), but she emerges a fully realized character. Offering his typically lively dialogue and strong supporting cast, Yep (Dragon's Gate) also integrates period detail into a well-honed plot. A "Then and Now" afterword draws on Yep's story to contrast conditions facing girls in 19th- century China with those today. Ages 9-12. (Oct.) <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4-7. This title in the Girls of Many Lands series is set in 1857 in Canton, China, during the Opium Wars with Britain. Twelve-year-old Spring Pearl, recently orphaned, misses her parents and her home, though she knows she should be grateful to the wealthy Sung family for taking her in. Master Sung is kind, but his wife and daughters are condescending and rude, disapproving of Spring Pearl's independent ways. Spring Pearl perseveres, finding solace in reviving the Sungs' long-neglected garden. Then the British invade, the Sungs face dire consequences, and the orphan and the family must join together to protect their home and lives. Spring Pearl emerges as a likable character who follows her heart despite challenges, and her descriptive, first-person narrative is personable, often poignant, incorporating both humorous commentary and insightful observations about the events and people around her. Yep does a smooth job of working in historical detail, and there's an afterward describing girls' lives in China, past and present. As with other books in the series, this includes photos and an author's note. <i>Shelle Rosenfeld</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But then, he found another. And another. Eventually he managed to find dozens, aged 101 to 113, and interview them. All are gone now.<br><br>A decade-long odyssey to recover the story of a forgotten generation and their Great War led Rubin across the United States and France, through archives, private collections, and battlefields, literature, propaganda, and even music. But at the center of it all were the last of the last, the men and women he met: a new immigrant, drafted and sent to France, whose life was saved by a horse; a Connecticut Yankee who volunteered and fought in every major American battle; a Cajun artilleryman nearly killed by a German aeroplane; an 18-year-old Bronx girl &#x201c;drafted&#x201d; to work for the War Department; a machine-gunner from Montana; a Marine wounded at Belleau Wood; the 16-year-old who became America&#x2019;s last WWI veteran; and many, many more. <br><br>They were the final survivors of the millions who made up the American Expeditionary Forces, nineteenth-century men and women living in the twenty-first century. Self-reliant, humble, and stoic, they kept their stories to themselves for a lifetime, then shared them at the last possible moment, so that they, and the World War they won &#x2013; the trauma that created our modern world &#x2013; might at last be remembered.

Ultimately, he found dozens, aged 101 to 113, from Cape Cod to Carson City, who shared with him at the last possible moment their stories of America&#x2019;s Great War. Nineteenth-century men and women living in the twenty-first century, they were self-reliant, humble, and stoic, never complaining, but still marveling at the immensity of the war they helped win, and the complexity of the world they helped create.

What&#x2019;s more, science is starting to show that our modern lifestyle of completely eschewing bacteria via pasteurized foods, hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and antibiotics is actually making us more, not less, susceptible to illness and allergies. Regular inclusion of fermented foods in the diet naturally combats bad bacteria and strengthens the immune system. <i>Fermented Foods for Health </i>includes meal plans of fermented foods for addressing specific ailments and repairing the metabolism. Seventy-five delicious recipes show readers how to ferment everything from meats to vegetables, fruits, and dairy&#x2014;and how to utilize each of them for specific health benefits such as balancing the body's PH, increasing enzyme production, and strengthening immunity.</p></p><p><p><b>Deirdre Rawlings, PhD, ND</b>,&nbsp;is a naturopathic doctor, certified nutritionist, sports nutritionist, and healthy-cooking coach.

In Thucydides, Donald Kagan, one of our foremost classics scholars, illuminates the great historian and his work both by examining him in the context of his time and by considering him as a revisionist historian.<br> <p><br> Thucydides took a spectacular leap into modernity by refusing to seek explanations for human behavior in the will of the gods, or even in the will of individuals, looking instead at the behavior of men in society. In this context, Kagan explains how The Peloponnesian War differs significantly from other accounts offered by Thucydides' contemporaries and stands as the first modern work of political history, dramatically influencing the manner in which history has been conceptualized ever since.</p></p><p><p>Donald Kagan is Sterling Professor of Classics and History at Yale University. His four-volume <b>History of the Peloponnesian War</b> is the leading scholarly work on the subject. He is also the author of many books on ancient and modern topics.</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Tracy Lee Simmons "The whole earth is the sepulcher of famous men," the Greek historian Thucydides wrote, and we moderns will always be ready to wake them from the slumber of their fame. One of the most eminently and, now, predictably quotable figures of the classical world, Thucydides assuredly deserves his press. Few so well understood the machinations of the human heart and mind when facing the extremities of the human predicament -- plague, betrayal, defeat and abject humiliation in war -- and fewer still could distill the hard-won wisdom of experience into tight, shimmering phrases and radiant, lapidary passages, which is why so many generations of students have had to read him. He is the favorite of Cleo, the muse of history, "to whom we turn when we have lost control," as W. H. Auden put it. It was he who described disasters "such as have occurred and always will occur as long as the nature of mankind remains the same." We have gone to him more for lessons than for facts. If Herodotus retains his proper title as the "father of history," Thucydides, his younger contemporary and author of the "History of the Peloponnesian War," an elaborate account of that bloody 30-year internecine spat between Athens and Sparta in the 5th century, B.C., might be called the father of all those historians who aspire to comprehend the past coolly, objectively, dispassionately, scientifically and without a brief for any partisan cause. He was the first sociologist. Or so we have blithely tended to believe. After spending an entire career sitting studiously at the feet of Thucydides, Donald Kagan, professor of classics and history at Yale and author of his own four-volume study of the Peloponnesian War, has drawn a bead on his most famous progenitor. The portrait that emerges, while both suitably erudite and freshly provocative, will fail to please most of those who have learned more to revere the great historian than to view him as a human being and political operator beset with all the flaws to which flesh is heir. But that is the man Kagan chooses to examine -- "the man himself in the world of action, not merely of thought." The result is less about the actual events of the past and more about how they get written up and embalmed for posterity. Kagan reminds us most saliently that, contrary to prevailing notions that Thucydides penned his work from a distant, Olympian remove, he was actually a participant -- an accomplice, really -- in the war he so eloquently and painstakingly depicted; his was a partisan's point of view. A general high in the Athenian command earlier in the war, he was forced into exile after he lost Amphipolis to the enemy in 422. Years later, he wrote his account to defend his actions and indeed those of his class. Democracy was, he believed, ever prone to dangle before citizens the deceptive promises and baubles of demagogues like Alcibiades, at whose door he placed blame for the Sicilian debacle. And so it was Athenian democracy itself that caused Athens's eventual defeat, not her more enlightened generals like Nicias and himself. The "History," according to Kagan, represented as much as anything else Thucydides' apologia, not a detached rationalist's tale of simple cause and effect. Absent from this brief but well-argued book, then, is the Thucydides some of us venerate, the one whose warnings against the less tangible depredations of war echo down the centuries -- of how, for example, language itself can suffer when the battle is joined. "Words had to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them," he wrote. "Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness." It's his wisdom we recall and value now, not the correctness or even the identity of his political or military alliances, however legitimately critical those may be for pinning down his historical self. We ought not to conclude, though, that Kagan's is a work of perfervid revisionism, at least not revisionism of the pejorative kind. All historical writing is an act of revision, an exercise in re-seeing figures and events of former times in the light of new or neglected evidence. The task Kagan set himself has been to reveal the motives of the man behind the maxims, not to chip away at this monolith that remains a landmark for students of the past. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

He presents the period as a time of determination, especially on the part of recently emancipated black Americans, to put into effect the principles of equal rights and citizenship for all.<br><br>Drawing on a wide range of long-neglected documents, he places a new emphasis on the centrality of the black experience to an understanding of the era. We see African Americans as active agents in overthrowing slavery, in helping win the Civil War, and&#x2013;even more actively&#x2013;in shaping Reconstruction and creating a legacy long obscured and misunderstood. Foner makes clear how, by war&#x2019;s end, freed slaves in the South built on networks of church and family in order to exercise their right of suffrage as well as gain access to education, land, and employment.<br><br>He shows us that the birth of the Ku Klux Klan and renewed acts of racial violence were retaliation for the progress made by blacks soon after the war. He refutes lingering misconceptions about Reconstruction, including the attribution of its ills to corrupt African American politicians and &#x201c;carpetbaggers,&#x201d; and connects it to the movements for civil rights and racial justice.<br><br>Joshua Brown&#x2019;s illustrated commentary on the era&#x2019;s graphic art and photographs complements the narrative.

Cold November rains drenched the earth and lent everything the gloomy air of a Flemish landscape: the ground crew in rain gear, a flag atop a squat airport building, a BMW billboard. So-Germany again.<br><br>Once the plane was on the ground, soft music began to flow from the ceiling speakers: a sweet orchestral cover version of the Beatles' "Norwegian Wood." The melody never failed to send a shudder through me, but this time it hit me harder than ever.<br><br>I bent forward in my seat, face in hands to keep my skull from splitting open. Before long one of the German stewardesses approached and asked in English if I were sick. "No," I said, "just dizzy."<br><br>"Are you sure?"<br><br>"Yes, I'm sure. Thanks."<br><br>She smiled and left, and the music changed to a Billy Joel tune. I straightened up and looked out the plane window at the dark clouds hanging over the North Sea, thinking of what I had lost in the course of my life: times gone forever, friends who had died or disappeared, feelings I would never know again.<br><br>The plane reached the gate. People began unlatching their seatbelts and pulling baggage from the storage bins, and all the while I was in the meadow. I could smell the grass, feel the wind on my face, hear the cries of the birds. Autumn 1969, and soon I would be twenty.<br><br>The stewardess came to check on me again. This time she sat next to me and asked if I was all right.<br><br>"I'm fine, thanks," I said with a smile. "Just feeling kind of blue."<br><br>"I know what you mean," she said. "It happens to me, too, every once in a while."<br><br>She stood and gave me a lovely smile. "Well, then, have a nice trip.<i> Auf Wiedersehen</i>."<br><br>"<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>."<br>Eighteen years have gone by, and still I can bring back every detail of that day in the meadow. Washed clean of summer's dust by days of gentle rain, the mountains wore a deep, brilliant green. The October breeze set white fronds of head-tall grasses swaying. One long streak of cloud hung pasted across a dome of frozen blue. It almost hurt to look at that far-off sky. A puff of wind swept across the meadow and through her hair before it slipped into the woods to rustle branches and send back snatches of distant barking-a hazy sound that seemed to reach us from the doorway to another world. We heard no other sounds. We met no other people. We saw only two bright, red birds leap startled from the center of the meadow and dart into the woods. As we ambled along, Naoko spoke to me of wells.<br><br>Memory is a funny thing. When I was in the scene, I hardly paid it any mind. I never stopped to think of it as something that would make a lasting impression, certainly never imagined that eighteen years later I would recall it in such detail. I didn't give a damn about the scenery that day. I was thinking about myself. I was thinking about the beautiful girl walking next to me. I was thinking about the two of us together, and then about myself again. It was the age, that time of life when every sight, every feeling, every thought came back, like a boomerang, to me. And worse, I was in love. Love with complications. Scenery was the last thing on my mind.<br><br>Now, though, that meadow scene is the first thing that comes back to me. The smell of the grass, the faint chill of the wind, the line of the hills, the barking of a dog: these are the first things, and they come with absolute clarity. I feel as if I can reach out and trace them with a fingertip. And yet, as clear as the scene may be, no one is in it. No one. Naoko is not there, and neither am I. Where could we have disappeared to? How could such a thing have happened? Everything that seemed so important back then-Naoko, and the self I was then, and the world I had then: where could they have all gone? It's true, I can't even bring back Naoko's face-not right away, at least. All I'm left holding is a background, sheer scenery, with no people up front.<br><br>True, given time enough, I can bring back her face. I start joining images-her tiny, cold hand; her straight, black hair so smooth and cool to the touch; a soft, rounded earlobe and the microscopic mole just beneath it; the camel's hair coat she wore in the winter; her habit of looking straight into your eyes when asking a question; the slight trembling that would come to her voice now and then (as if she were speaking on a windy hilltop)-and suddenly her face is there, always in profile at first, because Naoko and I were always out walking together, side by side. Then she turns to me, and smiles, and tilts her head just a bit, and begins to speak, and she looks into my eyes as if trying to catch the image of a minnow that has darted across the pool of a limpid spring.<br><br>I do need that time, though, for Naoko's face to appear. And as the years have passed, the time has grown longer. The sad truth is that what I could recall in five seconds all too soon needed ten, then thirty, then a full minute-like shadows lengthening at dusk. Someday, I suppose, the shadows will be swallowed up in darkness. There is no way around it: my memory is growing ever more distant from the spot where Naoko used to stand-ever more distant from the spot where my old self used to stand. And nothing but scenery, that view of the meadow in October, returns again and again to me like a symbolic scene in a movie. Each time it appears, it delivers a kick to some part of my mind. "Wake up," it says. "I'm still here. Wake up and think about it. Think about why I'm still here." The kicking never hurts me. There's no pain at all. Just a hollow sound that echoes with each kick. And even that is bound to fade one day. At the Hamburg airport, though, the kicks were longer and harder than usual. Which is why I am writing this book. To think. To understand. It just happens to be the way I'm made. I have to write things down to feel I fully comprehend them.<br>Let's see, now, what was Naoko talking about that day?<br><br>Of course: the "field well." I have no idea whether such a well ever existed. It might have been an image or a sign that existed only inside Naoko, like all the other things she used to spin into existence inside her mind in those dark days. Once she had described it to me, though, I was never able to think of that meadow scene without the well. From that day forward, the image of a thing I had never laid eyes on became inseparably fused to the actual scene of the field that lay before me. I can go so far as to describe the well in minute detail. It lay precisely on the border where the meadow ended and the woods began-a dark opening in the earth a yard across, hidden by the meadow grass. Nothing marked its perimeter-no fence, no stone curb (at least not one that rose above ground level). It was nothing but a hole, a mouth open wide. The stones of its collar had been weathered and turned a strange muddy white. They were cracked and had chunks missing, and a little green lizard slithered into an open seam. You could lean over the edge and peer down to see nothing. All I knew about the well was its frightening depth. It was deep beyond measuring, and crammed full of darkness, as if all the world's darknesses had been boiled down to their ultimate density.<br><br>"It's really, <i>really</i> deep," said Naoko, choosing her words with care. She would speak that way sometimes, slowing down to find the exact word she was looking for. "But no one knows where it is," she continued. "The one thing I know for sure is that it's around here somewhere."<br><br>Hands thrust into the pockets of her tweed jacket, she smiled at me as if to say "It's true!"<br><br>"Then it must be incredibly dangerous," I said. "A deep well, but nobody knows where it is. You could fall in and that'd be the end of you."<br><br>"The end. Aaaaaaaah, splat. Finished."<br><br>"Things like that must actually happen."<br><br>"They do, every once in a while. Maybe once in two or three years. Somebody disappears all of a sudden, and they just can't find him. So then the people around here say, 'Oh, he fell in the field well.'"<br><br>"Not a nice way to die," I said.<br><br>"No, it's a terrible way to die," said Naoko, brushing a cluster of grass seed from her jacket. "The best thing would be to break your neck, but you'd probably just break your leg and then you couldn't do a thing. You'd yell at the top of your lungs, but nobody'd hear you, and you couldn't expect anybody to find you, and you'd have centipedes and spiders crawling all over you, and the bones of the ones who died before are scattered all around you, and it's dark and soggy, and way overhead there's this tiny, tiny circle of light like a winter moon. You die there in this place, little by little, all by yourself."<br><br>"Yuck, just thinking about it makes my flesh creep," I said. "Somebody should find the thing and build a wall around it."<br><br>"But nobody <i>can</i> find it. So make sure you don't go off the path."<br><br>"Don't worry, I won't."<br><br>Naoko took her left hand from her pocket and squeezed my hand. "Don't <i>you</i> worry," she said. "You'll be OK. <i>You</i> could go running all around here in the middle of the night and you'd <i>never </i>fall into the well. And as long as I stick with you, I won't fall in, either."<br><br>"Never?"<br><br>"Never!"<br><br>"How can you be so sure?"<br><br>"I just know," she said, increasing her grip on my hand and continuing on for a ways in silence. "I know these things. I'm always right. It's got nothing to do with logic: I just feel it. For example, when I'm really close to you like this, I'm not the least bit scared. Nothing dark or ...</p><h2>Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong</h2><p>Little seems to delight historian James W. Loewen, author of Lies My Teacher Told Me, more than picking apart the cherished myths of American history. Few Americans study history after high school--instead, Loewen writes, they turn to novels and Oliver Stone movies to learn about the past. And they turn to the landscape, to roadside historical markers, guidebooks, museums, and tours of battlefields, childhood homes, and massacre sites. If you were to trust those sources, Loewen suggests, you would learn, erroneously, that the first airplane flight took place not at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, but at Pittsburg, Texas. &#34;It must be true--an impressive-looking Texas state historical marker says so!&#34; Loewen chortles. In these entertaining pages, Loewen takes a region-by-region tour of the United States, pointing out historical oddments as he travels. For example, a massacre of white pioneers by Indians commemorated in Almo, Idaho, never took place, Loewen continues; neither did many other such events. Indeed, he insists, &#34;throughout the entire West between 1842 and 1859, of more than 400,000 pioneers crossing the plains, fewer than 400, or less than .1 percent, were killed by American Indians.&#34; And if you were to visit Helen Keller&#39;s Georgia birthplace, over which a Confederate flag flies, you would get the impression that Keller had been an unreconstructed daughter of the Old South, whereas she was in fact an early supporter of the NAACP. And so on. After finishing Loewen&#39;s alternately angry and bemused expos�, readers will likely never trust a roadside historical marker or tour guide again--which may prompt them to turn to history books to check things out for themselves. As well they should.</p><p>American Book Award-winner James W. Loewen taught race relations at the University of Vermont.

Maybe yours did, too. Dad thought it was "good for us," and I suppose in a way it was. Little did he suspect that it was also <i>bad</i> for us -- that the lies we encountered on our trips across the United States subtly distorted our knowledge of the past and warped our view of the world. My sister and I needed to unlearn the myths we were learning in school, but the historic sites we visited only amplified them and taught us new ones.<br><br>My most recent book, <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i>, told how American history as taught in most high schools distorts the past and turns many students off. One result is that only one American in six ever takes a course in American history after graduating from high school. Where then do Americans learn about the past? From many sources, of course -- historical novels, Oliver Stone movies -- but surely most of all from the landscape. History is told on the landscape all across America -- on monuments at the courthouse, by guides inside antebellum homes and aboard historic ships, by the names we give to places, and on roadside historical markers. This book examines the history that some of these places tell and the processes by which they come forward to tell it.<br><br>Markers, monuments, and preserved historic sites usually result from local initiative. Typically a private organization -- the Chamber of Commerce, a church congregation, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy -- takes the lead, but public monies are usually involved before it's unveiled. It follows that the site will tell a story favorable to the local community, and particularly to that part of the community that erected or restored it. An account from another point of view might be quite different and also more accurate.<br><br>Americans like to remember only the positive things, and communities like to publicize the great things that happened in them. One result is silliness: the first airplane was invented not by the Wright Brothers but by Rev. Burrell Cannon, and the first flight was not in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, but in Pittsburg, Texas. It must be true -- an impressive-looking Texas state historical marker says so! Meanwhile, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island all claim the first use of anesthesia. And markers in Brunswick, Georgia, and Brunswick County, Virginia, battle over where Brunswick stew was born.<br><br>A more important result is racism. People who put up markers and monuments and preserve historic houses are usually pillars of the white community. The recent spate of Martin Luther King avenues and monuments notwithstanding, Americans still live and work in a landscape of white supremacy. Especially in the South, but all across America, even on black college campuses, markers, monuments, and names on the landscape glorify those who fought to keep African Americans in chains as well as those who after Reconstruction worked to make them second-class citizens again. What person gets the most historical markers in any state? Not Lincoln in Illinois it turns out, or Washington in Virginia, but Nathan Bedford Forrest, Confederate cavalry general and first leader of the Ku Klux Klan, in Tennessee. And the white Southerners misguided enough <i>not</i> to be racist are ignored entirely or converted into "good white Southerners" when remembered. Thus Helen Keller's birthplace flies a Confederate flag, while <i>she</i> was an early supporter of the NAACP.<br><br>Other monuments express white domination over Native Americans. A later introductory essay, "Hieratic Scale in Historic Monuments," shows how sculptors typically place Native Americans lower than European Americans on historic monuments. Whites always wind up in positions of power and action while people of color are passive on the bottom. Lame Deer, a Dakota leader, sees the same message in the four European American faces carved on Mount Rushmore:<br>What does this Mount Rushmore mean to us Indians? It means that these big white faces are telling us, "First we gave you Indians a treaty that you could keep these Black Hills forever, as long as the sun would shine, in exchange for all the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Montana. Then we found the gold and took this last piece of land, because we were stronger, and there were more of us than there were of you, and because we had cannons and Gatling guns....And after we did all this we carved up this mountain, the dwelling place of your spirits, and put our four gleaming white faces here. We are the conquerors.<br><br>The language at historic sites is also warped. All across the country Americans call Native Americans by tribal names that are wrong and even derogatory. According to these histories on the landscape Indians are "savage," whites "discover" everything, and some causes portrayed as stainless today were drenched in blood in their own time.<br><br>Then there is the matter of who gets memorialized and who gets left out. All too often, memorials heroify people who should not be forgotten, but who should never have been <i>commemorated</i> -- Jeffrey Amherst for example, who initiated germ warfare in the Americas and for whom Amherst College and Amherst, Massachusetts, are named. Across America the landscape commemorates those men and women who opposed each agonizing next step our nation took on the path toward freedom and justice, while the courageous souls who challenged the United States to live out the meaning of its principles lie forgotten or even reviled. Markers and monuments in many states leave out women, sometimes so totally as to be unwittingly hilarious. The only white woman to get a historical marker in Indiana, to take one offending state, gets remembered for coming into the state minus a body part she lost in Kentucky! Kentucky, meanwhile, erected (the right word) a female Civil War horse with an extra body part that turns her into a him! Historic sites also cover up or lie about the sexual orientations of people who made their history if those orientations were gay or lesbian.<br><br>Another form of omission takes place at historic homes, which often do not take their own history seriously enough to bother to tell it like it was. Instead of telling visitors what happened to the people who lived and worked there, guides prattle on about what the guests ate and the silverware they used. Even at important historic sites like Independence Hall, guides tell charming but inconsequential and ultimately boring anecdotes rather than talk about the historic events that happened there. <br><br>Guides almost always avoid negative or controversial facts, and most monuments, markers, and historic sites omit any blemishes that might taint the heroes they commemorate, making them larger and less interesting than life. (High school history textbooks do the same thing.) Presidents especially must be perfect. When historian Richard Shenkman asked a tour guide at FDR's family mansion in Hyde Park, New York, about Roosevelt's mistresses, she told him "the guides are specifically forbidden from talking about this." Woodrow Wilson's house in Washington, D.C., says nothing negative about the man who segregated the federal government; a temporary exhibit even credited him with supporting women's suffrage, which he opposed. Even Franklin Pierce, arguably our least popular president, is lauded by the historical marker in his hometown.<br><br>But inventing blemish-free heroes doesn't really work. High school students don't really buy that the founding fathers were flawless and don't think of them as heroes to emulate. Instead they conclude that history textbooks are dishonest. Similarly, adult Americans don't really believe that their exalted forebears were as perfect as their monuments claim. I have watched tourists grow passive while guides tell them quaint stories about dead presidents. They don't know enough to ask about what's being left out, and the social situation doesn't encourage visitors to ask substantive questions, so they just traipse from room to room on automatic pilot. A critical question to ask at any historic site is: What does it leave out about the people it treats as heroes? <br><br>A special form of these omissions occurs at war museums, which present war without anguish and instead focus genially on its technology.<i> USS Intrepid</i> in New York City leaves out the Vietnam War entirely -- too "political" for its board of directors. Omissions such as this can be hard to detect, especially for visitors who come to a site to learn a little history without bringing some knowledge of the site with them. People don't usually think about images that aren't there. <br><br>And some images don't exist anywhere. Scottsboro, Alabama, became world-famous for exactly one incident -- the Scottsboro Case -- but although downtown Scottsboro boasts four historical markers, none mention the Scottsboro Case. "Pay attention to what they tell you to forget," poet Muriel Rukeyser once wrote, and this book does -- it covers the Scottsboro Case and three events in Richmond, a city that truncates its public memory on the day the Confederacy ceased to rule it, because of their importance -- and because they are <i>not</i> recognized on the landscape. Nowhere have I seen portrayed the multicultural nature of pioneer settlements, where Native Americans, European Americans, and often African Americans lived and worked together, sometimes happily. Only an obscure marker in Utah offers any hint of the trade in Indian slaves that started in 1513 and continued at least until the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. All across America, the landscape suffers from amnesia, not about everything, but about many crucial events and issues of our past.<br><br>When the landscape does not omit unpleasant stories entirely, it often tells them badly, even by the mediocre standards set by u.s. history textbooks. Except for the Chief Vann House, a state historic site in Georgia, historic sites and museums in the United States rarely depict Native American farms, frame houses, or schools compared to the enormous number of tipis they display. Thus they portray American Indians as mobile and romantic -- even when they weren't! What tourists learn about slavery by visiting most historic sites is trifling compared to the more accurate information that current textbooks provide to high school students. On Reconstruction, that period after the Civil War when the federal government tried to guarantee equal rights for African Americans, the landscape is almost silent; most sites that do mention it present a distorted "Gone With the Wind" version that never happened. Little trace remains today of the lynchings and race riots that swept the United States between 1890 and 1925, the "nadir of race relations." All across America, monuments to the Spanish-American War, which was over in three months, are inscribed "1898-1902"; few visitors realize that those dates refer to the larger and longer Philippine-American War, which otherwise has mostly vanished from the landscape and from our historical memory. <br><br>The antithesis of omission is overemphasis, and the history written on the American landscape is largely the history of the federal governments -- United States of America and Confederate States of America -- and particularly of their wars. We infer much of what we know about the ancient Mayans and Egyptians from their public sculptures and monuments. What will archaeologists ages hence infer about us? That we venerated war above all other human activities?<br><br>America has ended up with a landscape of denial. James Buchanan's house denies that our fifteenth president was gay. The Willa Cather Pioneer Memorial denies that Nebraska's most enduring writer was lesbian. Fort Pillow denies that Nathan Bedford Forrest's Confederates massacred surrendered u.s. troops there. The National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum denies that mining today causes any environmental damage. And so it goes, from sea to shining sea. These misrepresentations on the American landscape help keep us ignorant as a people, less able to understand what really happened in the past, and less able to apply our understanding to issues facing the United States today. <br><br>The thoughtful visitor can learn to read between the lines of historical markers however, and deconstruct the imagery on historic monuments. Then these sites divulge important insights not only about the eras they describe but also about the eras in which they were built. In short, the lies and omissions memorialized across the American countryside suggest times and ways that the United States went astray as a nation. They also point to unresolved issues in a third era -- our own. That's why it may be more important to understand what the historical landscape gets wrong than what it gets right. <br><br>So come along as we visit more than a hundred markers, monuments, houses, and other historic sites in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. Our journey will start in the West, mirroring the journey the first people made as they discovered the Americas and settled it from west to east. People got to the Americas by boat from northeast Asia or by walking across the Bering Strait during an ice age. Most Indians in the Americas can be traced by blood type, language similarity, and other evidence to a very small group of first arrivals. Thus they may have come by boat. Either way, afoot or by boat, evidence suggests that people entered Alaska first: Native Americans share some cultural and physical similarities with northern Asians to the west of Alaska.<br><br>Beginning in the west has the additional benefit of being unconventional. "How refreshing it would be," ethnohistorian James Axtell wrote, "to find a textbook that began on the West Coast before treating the traditional eastern colonies." The usual approach to the American past is from the vantage point of Boston, looking southwestward. Travel books too start in New England, even though Japan sends more tourists to the United States than any other nation. Europeans -- Spaniards -- were also living in New Mexico years before Anglos had moved to New England or Virginia, so it is doubly appropriate for us to make our trip from west to east. Therefore we will begin in the state that extends farthest west, Alaska, and end in Maine, farthest east. You don't have to go that direction, however. The Index of States invites you to proceed alphabetically by state or to begin with whatever state interests you, and cross-references within and at the end of entries encourage you to explore topically related entries.<br><br>On our journey, not only will we uncover new facts about the American past, we will also catch indications of hidden fault lines in the social structure of the United States today. Some of these places are familiar to millions of Americans: Boston Common, Valley Forge, the Jefferson Memorial, Abraham Lincoln's log cabin, Sutter's Fort. Other entries in this book will visit places and tell stories that have <i>not</i> been memorialized grandly on the landscape. You will meet people whose existence you may never have imagined -- Elizabeth Van Lew, for instance, Robert and Mary Ann Lumpkin, Print Matthews -- and perhaps learn some facts you never imagined about famous Americans you thought you knew well. <br><br>Some of these sites lie far off well-traveled tourist paths and never get into most travel guidebooks. Other markers or statues stand in oft-visited places, but unobtrusively, such as the plaques in the entry halls of state capitols. Although few writers have commented on most of these monuments and markers, they too make a difference because they represent the thousands of other historic sites all across A...</p><h2>Houses of Stone</h2><p>Aspiring literary scholar Karen Holloway&#39;s discovery of a barely legible volume of verse from the nineteenth century encourages her to unlock its mysteries, discovering her own past wrapped up in the manuscript. 100,000 first printing.

After walking around the van and placing two reflective orange safety cones at the front and rear bumpers, he had returned to the driver&#x2019;s seat and waited for the signal on the throwaway mobile telephone. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The position gave him an unobstructed view twenty yards up the red-bricked drive to the valet kiosk and the entrance of The Rittenhouse, a high-rise that housed a five-star hotel and ultra-luxury condominiums. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; If Center City was considered the wealthiest section of America&#x2019;s fifth-largest city&#x2014;and it unequivocally was&#x2014;then The Rittenhouse, overlooking the heavily treed and expensively landscaped Rittenhouse Square Park, which William Penn first designed in the seventeenth century, was without question one of the city&#x2019;s classiest addresses. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The white panel van had magnetic three-foot-square signage on its front doors that read keycom cable tv install contractor, penna. license 3-246. Just to the left of the passenger door signage, midway up the body of the van, was a chromed, twelve-inch-square door, above which was a sticker with red lettering: a/c power 110 volts only! &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Inside the back of the van, behind the chromed door, sat an obese, olive-skinned forty-year-old with a puffy, pockmarked face and thinning, greased-back hair. He wore a gray hooded sweatshirt and heavy denim workman&#x2019;s overalls and was slumped in a heavy chair that had been salvaged from an Italian restaurant&#x2019;s dumpster. The wooden chair was bolted to the metal floor of the van directly behind the passenger seat, the chair&#x2019;s back to the partition. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Across his lap he held a black Remington twelve-gauge pump shotgun that had a short polymer pistol grip mounted in place of the longer standard shoulder stock. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he doing?&#x201d; the obese man said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s they,&#x201d; the driver said. &#x201c;Target&#x2019;s got some jagoff with him.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Approaching the kiosk were two well-built, clean-cut men in their early thirties, one blond and the other dark-haired, both over six feet tall and dressed somewhat identically in sweaters, blue jeans, and pointed-toe Western boots. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The man in the back chuckled. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Sucks to be that guy,&#x201d; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He fought the urge to crack open the chromed door, from which they had removed the original plug receptacle, and have a quick look. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re getting their car at the valet stand,&#x201d; the driver said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;About damn time,&#x201d; the obese man replied, then inhaled deeply. &#x201c;This smell of grilled steak is making me starved.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Tell me about it,&#x201d; the driver said, nervously drumming his gloved fingers on the steering wheel. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna eat like kings after this job.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The driver watched as one of the three valets&#x2014;That really is one fine-looking bitch to be parking cars, he thought&#x2014;trotted to the far leg of the A-shaped drive, where more than a dozen vehicles were neatly backed into a row of parking slots along the drive&#x2019;s exit. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She passed a silver Bentley Mulsanne sedan, which was at the far end, and a red Aston Martin Vanquish coupe before getting into a glistening black Cadillac SUV. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an Escalade,&#x201d; the driver said. &#x201c;And that Caddy&#x2019;s brand-fucking-new. Still got the window sticker on it.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She quickly maneuvered the enormous SUV around the fountain in the center of the drive and brought it to a stop in front of the two tall men at the kiosk. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The valet hopped down from the driver&#x2019;s seat and stood erect, putting her right hand, palm out, against her lower back as she held open the door with her left. One of the male valets went to the front passenger door, opened it, and assumed the same erect stance. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The dark-haired male came around the SUV, handed the valet what looked like a tip, then got in behind the wheel. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Target is getting in the passenger seat,&#x201d; the van&#x2019;s driver said, starting the engine and pulling the gearshift down into low. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; the obese male replied, then, after a moment, grunted and added, &#x201c;Not that it&#x2019;s gonna matter much where the bastard sits.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The man in back then began shuffling his feet in order to sit up in the chair. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He racked the action of the shotgun, loading a round of double-aught buckshot into the breech with a solid, metallic Ka-Chunk-Chunk! He then rotated the weapon onto its side, dug his gloved hand into a pocket, came out with another round of double-aught, and shoved it through the slot in the bottom, topping off the magazine tube. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The van driver saw the brake lights of the Escalade illuminate, then the backup lights briefly flash once, indicating the vehicle was being shifted into drive. The SUV started rolling&#x2014;then, twenty feet later, its brake lights lit up again and it came to a stop. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; the driver said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;What?&#x201d; the man in back said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Hang on.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond the kiosk, a tall blonde in a long dress emerged from the building. She looked to be in her thirties, and moved quickly toward the SUV. When the passenger reached his arm out the window, she handed him a thick envelope. Then the blonde blew a kiss, smiled and waved, and turned back toward the building. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Okay, finally we&#x2019;re going!&#x201d; the driver said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As he began taking his foot off the brake, he quickly checked the mirror on his door for traffic&#x2014;and saw a black Porsche 911 fast approaching with its right-turn signal blinking. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; he said, pressing hard on the brake pedal. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The Porsche&#x2019;s horn briefly sounded twice, then the car cut across his front bumper and went up the drive, pulling in behind the Escalade. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The SUV began to circle the fountain at the top of the drive. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The van driver checked his mirror again and saw a line of four cars. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Aw, come on . . .&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;While that might be a valid point, Chad, right now I really don&#x2019;t give a damn what my doctor says,&#x201d; Matt Payne said, steering the 911 into the just vacated spot in front of the valet kiosk. He was talking on his smartphone via the Porsche&#x2019;s audio system, the device plugged into the car&#x2019;s USB port. &#x201c;The incision where they worked fixing the bullet damage still oozes a little, mostly around the sutures, but I&#x2019;m getting better.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne was a lithely muscled twenty-seven-year-old who stood six-foot and a solid one-seventy-five. He had deep, intelligent eyes and dark, thick hair that he kept clipped short. He wore a white, long-sleeved knit polo shirt and khakis, with brown suede chukka boots and a navy fleece jacket. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the jacket, a Colt .45 ACP Officers Model semiautomatic pistol hung beside his left bicep from a leather shoulder holster. A bifold wallet held his Philadelphia Police Department ID card and badge. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really on Amanda&#x2019;s shit list right now,&#x201d; Payne went on. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m going to surprise her with this condo that just got put on the market, I&#x2019;ve got to do this meeting now&#x2014;before someone goes and leases the damn thing out from under me. Then I can just get the rest of my stuff that wouldn&#x2019;t fit in Amanda&#x2019;s out of my place around the corner.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; To meet a City of Philadelphia requirement that members of the police department reside within the city limits, Payne had been paying his father a pittance to live in a tiny apartment in the garret of a brownstone overlooking Rittenhouse Square. The mansion, which had been in the Payne family since being built one hundred fifty years earlier, had had its three lower floors converted to modern office space and now housed the Delaware Valley Cancer Society. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Watching the valet trot over to his door, Payne put the Porsche&#x2019;s stick shift in neutral and reached between the seats and pulled up on the hand brake. He left he engine running. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to go. Call you later,&#x201d; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He broke off the connection by tapping the icon on the in-dash multifunction screen, then unplugged the phone from its cradle in the console. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The valet pulled the door open and assumed the erect stance. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Welcome back, Mr. Payne,&#x201d; she said. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He stepped out of the vehicle, wincing at the sharp pain from the wound. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The valet noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Are you all right, sir?&#x201d; she said, her facial expression one of genuine concern. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, fine. Melody, right? Thanks for asking. Indigestion, I think.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He smiled at her&#x2014;then, hearing the squeal of tires spinning behind him, jerked his head toward the street. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne saw that the white panel van he had just passed was racing away from the curb, an orange traffic cone flying off its front bumper. And, a moment later, he watched it screech to a dead stop in front of the Cadillac Escalade, which was approaching the brick drive&#x2019;s exit, about to pull onto the street. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The Escalade, its path now blocked, also screeched to a stop. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne then saw a chromed door in the side of the van swinging open. A black tube poked out of the hole. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; What the hell? &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Everyone get down!&#x201d; Payne shouted, pulling the valet prone behind the nose of the Porsche and using his body to shield her. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He reached inside his jacket and tugged the .45 from the shoulder holster. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At that exact moment there came the Boom! of a shotgun blast. Payne heard the distinctive sounds of the piercing of metal and the shattering of glass. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There were screams as people ran for cover, many fleeing into the park. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne looked over the Porsche&#x2019;s hood when he heard the Escalade&#x2019;s engine roar. He saw the SUV surging toward the van. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There then came another shotgun blast right before the SUV rammed the van. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The Escalade bounced off it, careened to the right, and accelerated down the street. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The van, tires squealing, raced after the Escalade. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne scanned the area as he got to his feet. With his free left hand, he helped Melody stand up. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He walked her quickly over to the kiosk, behind which the others were crouching. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; he said, releasing her arm. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah. Think so,&#x201d; she said, her voice shaking. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne, running back around the Porsche, scanned the area. He did not see anyone injured. But he clearly saw that the passenger door windows of the Bentley were shattered and there was a defined bullet hole in its crazed windshield. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; That&#x2019;s not from birdshot, Payne thought. That&#x2019;s buckshot. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He then heard behind him a woman yelling: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening? Was that Johnny?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne turned and looked. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Jesus. Is she fucking nuts? &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It was the tall blonde he more or less recalled walking away from the Escalade when he had pulled up. He had not paid her any particular attention; Center City crawled with really good-looking women and he had been distracted by his phone conversation. But now he saw that she was extremely attractive and elegantly dressed. Her sweeping dress and long hair flowed behind her as she rushed out from the high-rise and past the kiosk. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Police!&#x201d; Payne shouted at her from beside the door of the Porsche, which was still open. He held the .45 in his right hand, muzzle up and trigger finger along its slide, and pointed with his left toward the building entrance. &#x201c;Stay back!&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As the woman passed Melody, the valet intercepted her and tried persuading her to return to the building. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne squeezed in behind the wheel, wincing again at the sharp pain. After putting his phone and pistol on the passenger seat, he threw the stick shift into first gear, hitting the gas pedal while dumping the clutch. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The 911 leapt into motion and went screaming around the top of the drive. He caught a glimpse of the attractive blonde forcing her way past the valet and heading toward the street. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne shook his head. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She must be crazy . . . or have a death wish. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He laid steadily on the horn as he approached the brick drive&#x2019;s exit and then turned onto the street. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Ahead, the battered van now was racing almost side by side with the SUV. The two vehicles were quickly nearing the T intersection that was at the southwest corner of Rittenhouse Square. A line of nineteenth-century buildings loomed directly ahead. Around the corner was the brownstone with bronzed signage reading delaware valley cancer society. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There&#x2019;s no room for both to make that turn, Payne thought. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Damn&#x2014;they could hit my place. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne then saw the black tube again slide out of the chromed door on the right side of the van. He waited for another shotgun blast&#x2014;but then the Escalade swerved hard into the van. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The impact caused the van to go up on the sidewalk and almost into the park. The Escalade then sharply veered right. The driver overcorrected&#x2014;and the SUV slid sideways, its right tires clipping the opposite curb, causing the SUV to tip and then roll onto its roof. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Sonofabitch! Payne thought. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Sparks sprayed out from the Escalade as it slid down the street and then onto the sidewalk. It struck a tree and a lamppost, causing it to spin. Its rear end then slammed into the heavy stone wall of one of the two-hundred-year-old buildings. The impact compressed and then ripped open the fuel cell. Gasoline flowed out, then erupted in flames. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The white van braked and skidded sideways as it returned to the street. It then managed to make the left turn, passing within feet of the upside-down SUV. Billows of dense black smoke now rose above the thick orange-and-red flames coming from the rear of the vehicle. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Payne had just decided on the closest spot ahead that he could park in order to extricate whoever was in the SUV. But then he saw two blue shirts&#x2014;Philadelphia police officer, detective, and corporal ranks wore uniforms with blue shirts; higher ranks, including the commissioner, wore ones of white&#x2014;run out of the park and approach the scene. They passed more people who ...</p><h2>The Sweet Cheat Gone (Remembrance of Things Past) (English and French Edition)</h2><p>In the sixth novel of Proust&#39;s series, Mademoiselle Albertine leaves Paris and consequentially, creates a psychological panic</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Gem Identification Made Easy, 1st Edition: A Hands-On Guide to More Confident Buying and Selling</h2><p>Contents: Setting Up a Basic Lab; Proper Lighting; How to Use Each Instrument &amp; What It Will Show; Major Errors and How to Correct Them, and more.

Even though the past two years have witnessed the Red Sox' finally putting an end to the Curse of the Bambino and the White Sox' bringing a championship to the South Side of Chicago for the first time in eighty-seven years, the sad truth is that the 2005 and 2006 seasons may be remembered as much for the league's scandals and blockbuster free-agent signings as they are for historic accomplishments on the field. Something has gone horribly wrong with the game, and according to Schmidt, it's time to do something about it.</p><p><em>Clearing the Bases</em> is a much-needed call to arms by one of baseball's most respected players. Drawing on his experiences as a third baseman, a manager, and, most recently, a fan, Schmidt takes on everything from skyrocketing payrolls, callous owners, and unapproachable players to inflated statistics, and, of course, ersatz home run kings. With bold and spirited counsel, Schmidt offers his own prescription for restoring integrity to the game and bringing baseball back, once and for all, to its rightful place.</p><p>More than just an old-timer's screed against the modern game, however, <em>Clearing the Bases</em> goes beyond the BALCO investigation and never-ending free-agent bonanzas that dominate the back pages. It also examines all that's right -- and what still needs work -- with our national pastime, including interleague play, expansion, and, most surprisingly, better all-around hitters. </p><p>Riveting, wise, and illuminating, <em>Clearing the Bases</em> is a Hall of Famer's look at how Major League Baseball has lost its way and how it can head back home.</p></p><p><p>Mike Schmidt is the greatest-hitting third baseman in the history of baseball. Named Player of the Decade for the 1980s by the <em>Sporting News</em>, he was selected to the MLB All-Century Team in 1999. He lives in Florida with his family.</p><br><br><p>Glen Waggoner, a founding editor of <em>ESPN The Magazine</em>, is the coauthor of Bobby Murcer&#x2019;s <em>New York Times</em> bestselling autobiography <em>A Yankee for Life</em>, as well as the bestsellers <em>My Life In &amp; Out of the Rough</em> with John Daly and <em>Clearing the Bases</em> with Mike Schmidt. Waggoner was one of the founding fathers of Rotisserie League Baseball, which sparked the fantasy sports movement in America.</p>What would otherwise be a light narrative on life as a major leaguer--with opinions thrown in on various baseball issues of the day--is suddenly serious reading when the author is Mike Schmidt, a Hall-of-Fame third-baseman and one of the best to play the game. Although Schmidt backs off the statement he made on HBO last summer about steroid use--he would have used them, he said then, if they had been available when he played--readers of this volume will appreciate how Schmidt's drive to succeed might have led him to performance-enhancing drugs. Schmidt offers thoughtful opinions on home-run records broken in the steroid era (no asterisks, but view them with clarity), on Pete Rose (ban from managing, but admit into the Hall of Fame), on selecting players for the Hall (use a panel of Hall members for their seasoned input), and on the finer points of playing and managing the game. There are some good anecdotes on teammates, too. Recommended for its ongoing discussion of baseball's concerns and because it's Mike Schmidt doing the talking. <i>Alan Moores</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It was largely within the high-pressure world of competitive gymnastics that Nassar exploited young girls, who were otherwise motivated by fear and intimidation, sexually assaulting hundreds of them under the guise of medical treatment. <br><br>In<i> Start by Believing</i>, John Barr and Dan Murphy confront Nassar's acts, which represent the largest sex abuse scandal to impact the sporting world.

He played all of the great players from Lasker to Fischer in tournaments and studied all of their games in great detail. He knew more about them and their games than anybody else. Max Euwe was born on May 20, 1901 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Euwe was certainly the most active and prolific writer about the game. He was never a professional player. He had a real job. He was a math professor. After retirement he became a chess official. He was president of FIDE, the World Chess Federation, from 1970 to 1978. This was during the Cold War and Euwe had to make difficult decisions for the good of chess. It was absolutely, definitely because of Euwe that Bobby Fischer got to sit down at the board to play a match for the World Chess Championship. Fischer had been disqualified many times along the way, the first time being when he refused to play in the US Championship that was a necessary preliminary to the World Chess Championship competition. Max Euwe, himself a past world champion, acted as both referee and official at the famous Iceland matches in 1972. Max Euwe died on November 26, 1981 in his native Amsterdam at age 80. David Vincent Hooper was born in Reigate, England on August 31, 1915. He first attracted international attention by winning, with a round to spare, the tournament at Blackpool 1944. Although an amateur, he tied for fifth place in the 1949 British Championship at Felixstowe. He was the British correspondence chess champion in 1944 and the London Chess Champion in 1948. He played on the British team in the Chess Olympiad at Helsinki in 1952. He died on May 3, 1998 in the United Kingdom. Hooper was an expert in the chess endgame and in chess history of the nineteenth century. He is best known for his chess writing, including The Oxford Companion to Chess (1992 with Ken Whyld), Steinitz (Hamburg 1968, in German), and A Pocket Guide to Chess Endgames (London 1970).</p><h2>Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey</h2><p>The provocative and mind-bending new novel from the bestselling author of <b>Fight Club</b> and <b>Haunted</b>.<br><br><b>Rant</b> takes the form of a (fictional) oral history of Buster &#x201c;Rant&#x201d; Casey, in which an assortment of friends, enemies, admirers, detractors, and relations have their say on this evil character, who may or may not be the most efficient serial killer of our time.<br><br>Buster Casey was every small kid born in a small town, searching for real thrills in a world of video games and action/adventure movies.

Not to mention those hands.<br><br>To practice building rapport, I ask him what he paid for his ticket. If you can&#x2019;t determine the customer needs, identify the hot buttons, of some stranger rubbing arms with you on an airplane, you&#x2019;ll never talk anybody into taking &#x201c;mental ownership&#x201d; of a Nissan, much less a Cadillac.<br><br>For landing somebody in a car, another trick is: Every car on your lot, you program the number&#x2013;one radio&#x2013;station button to gospel music. The number&#x2013;two button, set to rock and roll. The number&#x2013;three, to jazz. If your prospect looks like a demander&#x2013;commander type, the minute you unlock the car you set the radio to come on with the news or a politics talk station. A sandal wearer, you hit the National Public Radio button. When they turn the key, the radio tells them what they want to hear. Every car on the lot, I have the number&#x2013;five button set to that techno&#x2013;raver garbage in case some kid who does Party Crashing comes around.<br><br>The green color of the hillbilly&#x2019;s eyes, the shit on his boots, salesmen call those &#x201c;mental pegs.&#x201d; Questions that have one answer, those are &#x201c;closed questions.&#x201d; Questions to get a customer talking, those are &#x201c;open questions.&#x201d;<br><br>For example: &#x201c;How much did your plane ticket set you back?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a closed question.<br><br>And, sipping from his own cup of whiskey, the man swallows. Staring straight ahead, he says, &#x201c;Fifty dollars.&#x201d;<br><br>A good example of an open question would be: &#x201c;How do you live with those scary chewed&#x2013;up hands?&#x201d;<br><br>I ask him: For one way?<br><br>&#x201c;Round&#x2013;trip,&#x201d; he says, and his pitted and puckered hand tips whiskey into his face. &#x201c;Called a &#x2018;bereavement fare,&#x2019; &#x201d; the hillbilly says.<br><br>Me looking at him, me half twisted in my seat to face him, my breathing slowed to match the rise and fall of his cowboy shirt, the technique&#x2019;s called: Active Listening. The stranger clears his throat, and I wait a little and clear my throat, copying him; that&#x2019;s what a good salesman means by &#x201c;pacing&#x201d; a customer.<br><br>My feet, crossed at the ankle, right foot over the left, same as his, I say: Impossible. Not even standby tickets go that cheap. I ask: How&#x2019;d he get such a deal?<br><br>Drinking his whiskey, neat, he says, &#x201c;First, what you have to do is escape from inside a locked insane asylum.&#x201d; Then, he says, you have to hitchhike cross&#x2013;country, wearing nothing but plastic booties and a paper getup that won&#x2019;t stay shut in back. You need to arrive about a heartbeat too late to keep a repeat child&#x2013;molester from raping your wife. And your mother. Spawned out of that rape, you have to raise up a son who collects a wagonful of folks&#x2019; old, thrown&#x2013;out teeth. After high school, your wacko kid got&#x2019;s to run off. Join some cult that lives only by night. Wreck his car, a half a hundred times, and hook up with some kind&#x2013;of, sort&#x2013;of, not&#x2013;really prostitute.<br><br>Along the way, your kid got&#x2019;s to spark a plague that&#x2019;ll kill thousands of people, enough folks so that it leads to martial law and threatens to topple world leaders. And, lastly, your boy got&#x2019;s to die in a big, flaming, fiery inferno, watched by everybody in the world with a television set.<br><br>He says, &#x201c;Simple as that.&#x201d;<br><br>The man says, &#x201c;Then, when you go to collect his body for his funeral,&#x201d; and tips whiskey into his mouth, &#x201c;the airline gives you a special bargain price on your ticket.&#x201d;<br><br>Fifty bucks, round&#x2013;trip. He looks at my scotch sitting on the tray table in front of me. Warm. Any ice, gone. And he says, &#x201c;You going to drink that?&#x201d;<br><br>I tell him: Go ahead.<br><br>This is how fast your life can turn around.<br><br>How the future you have tomorrow won&#x2019;t be the same future you had yesterday.<br><br>My dilemma is: Do I ask for his autograph? Slowing my breath, pacing my chest to his, I ask: Is he related to that guy...Rant Casey? &#x201c;Werewolf Casey&#x201d;&#x2014;the worst Patient Zero in the history of disease? The &#x201c;superspreader&#x201d; who&#x2019;s infected half the country? America&#x2019;s &#x201c;Kissing Killer&#x201d;? Rant &#x201c;Mad Dog&#x201d; Casey?<br><br>&#x201c;Buster,&#x201d; the man says, his monster hand reaching to take my scotch. He says, &#x201c;My boy&#x2019;s given name was Buster Landru Casey. Not Rant. Not Buddy. Buster.&#x201d;<br><br>Already, my eyes are soaking up every puckered scar on his fingers. Every wrinkle and gray hair. My nose, recording his smell of whiskey and cow shit. My elbow, recording the rub of his flannel shirtsleeve. Already, I&#x2019;ll be bragging about this stranger for the rest of my life. Holding tight to every moment of him, squirreling away his every word and gesture, I say: You&#x2019;re... <br><br>&#x201c;Chester,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Name&#x2019;s Chester Casey.&#x201d;<br><br>Sitting right next to me. Chester Casey, the father of Rant Casey: America&#x2019;s walking, talking Biological Weapon of Mass Destruction.<br><br>Andy Warhol was wrong. In the future, people won&#x2019;t be famous for fifteen minutes. No, in the future, everyone will sit next to someone famous for at least fifteen minutes. Typhoid Mary or Ted Bundy or Sharon Tate. History is nothing except monsters or victims. Or witnesses.<br><br>So what do I say? I say: I&#x2019;m sorry. I say, &#x201c;Tough break about your kid dying.&#x201d;<br><br>Out of sympathy, I shake my head...<br><br>And a few inhales later, Chet Casey shakes his head, and in that gesture I&#x2019;m not sure who&#x2019;s really pacing who. Which of us sat which way first. If maybe this shitkicker is studying me. Copying me. Finding my hot buttons and building rapport. Maybe selling me something, this living legend Chet Casey, he winks. Never breathing more than fifteen inhales any minute. He tosses back the scotch. &#x201c;Any way you look at it,&#x201d; he says, and elbows me in the ribs, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s still a damn sweet deal on an airplane ticket.&#x201d;<br><b>2</b>&#x2014;<b>Guardian Angels<br>From the Field Notes of Green Taylor Simms (Historian):</b> The hound dog is to Middleton what the cow is to the streets of Calcutta or New Delhi.

With this book at your side, we guarantee that you will never turn out a bland pot of soup or a greasy stew with tough stringy meat&#x2014;in fact, cooking favorite and new recipes will be easy and foolproof.What separates great corn chowder from the pack? For deep corn flavor, grate ears of corn to create a thick pulp bursting with fresh corn flavor, then add whole kernels at the last minute. And for richness and smoky flavor, saut� salt pork and leave it in the chowder as it simmers.What is the secret to rich-tasting beef stew? First, use beef chuck and cut your own stew meat (for consistency of texture and flavor); then skip the flouring step&#x2014;floured meat gives stew a weak, less beefy flavor. And for the perfect texture overall, cook the stew in the oven after browning the meat and add the vegetables in stages.How do you make the ultimate French Onion soup? The best French onion soup starts with caramelized red onions (they have the most intense sweetness and complexity of flavor) and two types of broth&#x2014;chicken and beef broth. And for the perfect cheesy crust, use Asiago for flavor and Swiss for meltability.How do you make great chicken cacciatore? Start with skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs for the deepest flavor, then discard the skin after the initial saut� to prevent the stew from becoming greasy. Add portobellos for earthy flavor and build a robust sauce with red wine and a Parmesan rind.</p><p>America&#x2019;s Test Kitchen is a real place: a no-nonsense, fully equipped test kitchen located just outside Boston, MA, where a team of highly qualified test cooks and editors perform thousands of tests every year.

Oars provided a level of control and maneuverabilty beyond the capabilities of the contemporary sailing ship, and not experienced again until the era of the screw propeller. Precise control allowed squadrons and fleets to operate together, as a unit, which promoted the evolution of earlier fighting tactics. However, for fleets to be more effective than collections of individual vessels, they needed training and organization, from which the first state-funded navies were to develop. <br> THE AGE OF THE GALLEY charts this development from the earliest paleolitic crafts, some of which were paddled rather than rowed, to the classical trireme and its Roman and Byzantine successors. However, as a warship, the galley survived the coming of the three-masted sailing ship and even adapted itself to gunpowder artillery, so later chapters are devoted to the medieval and Renaissance fleets that served the later maritime powers in the Mediterranean. <br> The principal historical chapters are backed by more general sections on the design and oar system of galleys, on the organization and infrastructure of galley fleets, and on non-military applications of the galley.<br> With the recent trials of the Greek Navy's reconstructed trireme, this volume has been able to take advantage of much new research; the upsurge in interest in these crafts <br>makes the publication of this work particularly welcome.<br> Lavishly illustrated, THE AGE OF THE GALLEY includes over 65 black-and-white photos, over 200 illustrations and 15 tables.</p><p>CONWAY'S HISTORY OF THE SHIP <p> The ship is probably the most influential tool in human history and it continues to exert a widespread and persistent fascination. CONWAY'S HISTORY OF THE SHIP is the first comprehensive and authoritative account of this technological and cultural phenomenon.<br> An unprecedented line-up of over one hundred leading maritime historians and specialists from around the world has been assembled to ensure that the work is informative, authoritative, and fully international in outlook.<br> Every significant ship type from the dawn of seafaring to the present day is analyzed in detailed in coherent essays. Each volume adopts a strong theme which allows it to stand alone, but throughout the series a strict chronological sequence has been maintained.</p></p><h2>New Ways of Gravure</h2><p>A noted artist describes both old and contemporary techniques for making prints and their use in creating works of art</p><p></p><h2>Solo: A James Bond Novel</h2><p>Set in 1969, Boyd&#39;s 007 story finds an experienced, older Bond sent to stop a civil war in the small West African nation of Zanzarim; but Bond goes solo, on his own mission to Washington DC and into geopolitical intrigue.</p><p>William Boyd was born in Accra, Ghana, in 1952.

His new number one Sunday Times bestseller is The Road to Little Dribbling: More Notes from a Small Island. His acclaimed book on the history of science, A Short History of Nearly Everything, won the Royal Society&#39;s Aventis Prize as well as the Descartes Prize, the European Union&#39;s highest literary award.

A former Chancellor of Durham University, he was President of the Campaign to Protect Rural England for five years, and is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society.Bryson offers a kid-friendly version of his popular-science compendium for adults, A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003), in this illustrated trip through, well, nearly everything. His enthusiasm is apparent right from the foreword, where he proclaims that &#x201c;there isn&#x2019;t anything in existence&#x2014;not a thing&#x2014;that isn&#x2019;t amazing and interesting when you look into it.&#x201d; He proceeds to back up this statement as he whirls through mind-numbing notions such as the creation of the universe and the life-span of an atom with good cheer and accessible, even exciting, writing. The two-page spreads meander their way through the various recesses of science with a combination of explanatory prose, historical anecdotes, wry asides, and illustrations that range from helpful to comical. Absent are source notes to back up Bryson&#x2019;s many claims (or any other back matter aside from an index, photo credits, and a list of Bryson&#x2019;s adult books). That isn&#x2019;t to say he shouldn&#x2019;t be trusted, but readers should take this for what it is: irreverent and illuminating edutainment, good for the science-phobic and -centric alike.

At eight, still too small to mount her horse unaided, she was galloping miles, alone, across Coorain, her parents' thirty thousand windswept, drought-haunted acres in the Australian outback, doing a "man's job" of helping herd the sheep because World War II had taken away the able-bodied men. She loved (and makes us see and feel) the vast unpeopled landscape, beautiful and hostile, whose uncertain weathers tormented the sheep ranchers with conflicting promises of riches and inescapable disaster. She adored (and makes us know) her large-visioned father and her strong, radiant mother, who had gone willingly with him into a pioneering life of loneliness and bone-breaking toil, who seemed miraculously to succeed in creating a warmly sheltering home in the harsh outback, and who, upon her husband's sudden death when Jill was ten, began to slide -- bereft of the partnership of work and love that had so utterly fulfilled her -- into depression and dependency.<br><br>We see Jill, staggered by the loss of her father, catapulted to what seemed another planet -- the suburban Sydney of the 1950s and its crowded, noisy, cliquish school life. Then the heady excitement of the University, but with it a yet more demanding course of lessons -- Jill embracing new ideas, new possibilities, while at the same time trying to be mother to her mother and resenting it, escaping into drink, pulling herself back, striking a balance. We see her slowly gaining strength, coming into her own emotionally and intellectually -and beginning the joyous love affair that gave wings to her newfound self.<br><br>Worlds away from Coorain, in America, Jill Conway became a historian and the first woman president of Smith College. Her story of Coorain and the road from Coorain startles by its passion and evocative power, by its understanding of the ways in which a total, deep-rooted commitment to place -- or to a dream -- can at once liberate and imprison. It is a story of childhood as both Eden and anguish, and of growing up as a journey toward the difficult life of the free.</p><p>"Sheer delight." --Washington Post<br><br>"A small masterpiece of scene, memory and very stylish English.

The search of the woman's baby carriage was quickly becoming anything but routine, and Josh moved in closer for his next shot.</p><p>He'd just been keeping himself busy while awaiting the arrival of a delegation of peacekeepers from several superpowers who would be meeting with the pope that morning, but like several other members of the press and tourists who'd been ignoring the altercation or losing patience with it, he was becoming concerned. Although searches went on every hour, every day, around the world, the potential for danger hung over everyone's lives, lingering like the smell of fire.</p><p>In the distance the sonorous sound of a bell ringing called the religious to prayer, its echo out of sync with the woman's shrill voice as she continued to protest. Then, with a huge shove, she pushed the carriage against the guard's legs, and just as Josh brought the image into that clarity he called "perfect vision," the kind of image that the newspaper would want, the kind of conflict they loved captured on film, he heard the blast.</p><p>Then a flash of bluish white light.</p><p>The next moment, the world exploded.</p><p>In the protective shadows of the altar, Julius and his brother whispered,reviewing their plans for the last part of the rescue and recovery. Each of them kept a hand on his dagger, prepared in case one of the emperor's soldiers sprang out of the darkness. In Rome, in theYear of their Lord 391, temples were no longer sanctuaries for pagan priests. Converting to Christianity was not a choice, but an official mandate. Resisting was a crime punishable by death. Blood spilled in the name of the Church was not a sin, it was the price of victory.</p><p>The two brothers strategized&#x2014;Drago would stay in the temple for an hour longer and then rendezvous with Julius at the tomb by the city gates. As a diversion, that morning's elaborate funeral had been a success, but they were still worried. Everything depended on this last part of their strategy going smoothly.</p><p>Julius drew his cape closed, touched his brother's shoulder, bidding him goodbye and good luck, and skulked out of the basilica, keeping to the building's edge in case anyone was watching. He heard approaching horses and the clatter of wheels. Flattening himself against the stone wall, Julius held his breath and didn't move. The chariot passed without stopping.</p><p>He'd finally reached the edge of the porch when, behind him, like a sudden avalanche of rocks, he heard an angry shout split open the silence: "Show me where the treasury is!"</p><p>This was the disaster Julius and his brother had feared and discussed, but Drago had been clear&#x2014;even if the temple was attacked, Julius was to continue on. Not turn back. Not try to help him. The treasure Julius needed to save was more important than any one life or any five lives or any fifty lives.</p><p>But then a razor-sharp cry of pain rang out, and ignoring the plan, he ran back through the shadows, into the temple and up to the altar.</p><p>His brother was not where he'd left him. "Drago?"</p><p>No answer. "Drago?"</p><p>Where was he?</p><p>Julius worked his way down one of the dark side aisles of the temple and up the next. When he found Drago, it wasn't by sound </p><p>He pulled him closer to the flickering torches. Drago's skin was already deathly pale, and his torn robe revealed a six-inch horizontal slash on his stomach crossing a vertical gash that cut him all the way down to his groin.</p><p>Julius gagged. He'd seen eviscerated carcasses of both man and beast before and had barely given them a passing glance. Sacrifices, felled soldiers or punished criminals were one thing. But this was Drago. This blood was his blood.</p><p>"You weren't...supposed to come back," Drago said, dragging every syllable out as if it was stuck in his throat. "I sent him...to look in the loculi...for the treasures. I thought...Stabbed me, anyway. But there's time...for us to get out...now...now!" Drago struggled to raise himself up to a sitting position, spilling his insides as he moved.</p><p>Julius pushed him down. "Now...we need...to go now." Drago's voice was weakening. Trying to staunch the blood flow, Julius put pressure on the laceration, willing the intestines and nerves and veins and skin to rejoin and fuse back together, but all he accomplished was staining his hands in the hot, sticky mess.</p><p>"Where are the virgins?" The voice erupted like Vesuvius without warning and echoed through the interior nave. Raucous laughter followed.</p><p>How many soldiers were there? "Let's find the booty we came here for," another voice chimed in. "Not yet, first I want one of the virgins. Where are the virgin whores?"</p><p>"The treasury first, you lecherous bastard."</p><p>More laughter.</p><p>So it wasn't one man; a regiment had stormed the temple. Shouting, demanding, blood-lust coating their words. Let them pillage this place, let them waste their energy, they'd come too late: there were no pagans to convert, no treasure left to find and no women left to rape, they'd all already been killed or sent into hiding.</p><p>"We have to go..."Drago whispered as once again he fought to rise.</p><p>He'd stayed behind to make sure everyone else got out safely. Why him, why Drago?</p><p>"You can't move, you've been hurt&#x2014;" Julius broke off, not knowing how to tell his brother that half of his internal organs were </p><p>"Then leave me.You need to get to her...Save her and the treasures.... No one...no one but you..."</p><p>It wasn't about the sacred objects anymore. It was about two people who both needed him desperately: the woman he loved and his brother, and the fates were demanding Julius sacrifice one of them for the other.</p><p><i>I can't let her die and I can't leave you to die. </i>No matter which one he chose,how would he live with the decision? "Look what I found," one of the soldiers shouted.</p><p>Screams of vengeance reverberated through the majestic hall. A shriek rang out above all the other noise. A woman's cry.</p><p>Julius crawled out, hid behind a column and peered into the nave. thrashing under the brute as the soldier pumped away so roughly that blood pooled under her. Who was the poor woman? Had she wandered in thinking she'd find a safe haven in the old temple, only to find she'd descended into hell? Could Julius help her? Take the men by surprise? No, there were too many of them. At least eight he could see. By now the rape had attracted more attention, drawing other men who forgot about their search to crowd around and cheer on their compatriot.</p><p>And what would happen to Drago if he left his side?</p><p>Then the question didn't matter because beneath his hands, Julius felt his brother's heart stop.</p><p><i>He felt his heart stop.</i></p><p>Julius beat Drago's chest, pumping and trying, trying but failing to stimulate the beating. Bending down, he breathed into his brother's mouth,forcing his own air down his throat,waiting for any sign of life.</p><p>Finally, his lips still on his brother's lips, his arm around his brother's neck, he wept, knowing he was wasting precious seconds but unable to stop. Now he didn't have to choose between them&#x2014;he could go to the woman who was waiting for him at the city gates.</p><p><i>He must go to her.</i> backed up, found the wall and started crawling. There was a break in the columns up ahead; if he could get to it undetected, he might make it out.</p><p>And then he heard a soldier shout for him to halt.</p><p>If he couldn't save her, Julius would at least die trying, so, ignoring the order, he kept moving.</p><p>Outside, the air was thick with the black smoke that burned his lungs and stung his eyes. What were they incinerating now? No time to find out. Barely able to see what lay ahead of him, he kept running down the eerily quiet street. After the cacophony of the scene he'd just left, it was alarming to be able to hear his own footsteps. If someone was on the lookout the sound would give him away, but he needed to risk it.</p><p>Picturing her in the crypt, crouched in the weak light, counting the minutes, he worried that she would be anxious that he was late and torment herself that something had gone dangerously wrong. Her bravery had always been as steadfast as the stars; it was difficult even now to imagine her afraid. But this was a far different situation than anything she'd ever faced, and it was all his fault, all his shame.</p><p>They'd risked too much for each other. He should have been stronger, should have resisted.</p><p>And now, because of him, everything they treasured, especially their lives, was at stake.</p><p>Tripping over the uneven, cracked surfaces, he stumbled. The muscles in his thighs and calves screamed, and every breath irritated his lungs so harshly he wanted to cry out. Tasting dirt and grit mixed with his salty sweat as it dripped down his face and wet his lips, he would have given anything for water&#x2014;cold, sweet water from the spring, not this alkaline piss. His feet pounded the stones and more pain shot up through his legs, but still he ran.</p><p>Suddenly, raucous shouting and thundering footfalls filled the air. The ground reverberated, and from the intensity he knew the marauders were coming closer. He looked right, left. If he could find a sheltered alcove, he could flatten himself against the wall and pray they'd run past and miss him. As if that would help. He knew all about praying. He'd relied on it, believed in it. But the prayers he'd offered up might as well have been spit in the gutter for the good they'd done.</p><p>"The sodomite is getting away!"</p><p>"Scum of the earth."</p><p>"Scared little pig."</p><p>"Did you defecate yourself yet, little pig?"</p><p>They laughed,trying to outdo each other with slurs and accusations. Their chortles echoed in the hollow night, lingered on the hot wind, and then, mixed in with their jeers, another voice broke through.</p><p>"Josh?"</p><p><i>No,don't listen.Keep g...</i></p></p><h2>Gangsta Granny</h2><p><p>A story of prejudice and acceptance, funny lists and silly words, this new book has all the hallmarks of David's previous bestsellers.Our hero Ben is bored beyond belief after he is made to stay at his grandma's house.

Dominic traveled to London yesterday to take part, though I know he is conflicted. Robert Dudley has told him that someone other than his father is behind all the twists of treachery these last two years, but Robert will say no more to Dominic. He has demanded, rather, to see Elizabeth. Dominic asked me to help persuade her, but I did not try very hard. Why should she go? Whether there is one traitor or twenty in this, it was North-umberland himself who held Elizabeth and me prisoner. For that alone he must answer.</i><br></p><p> <br></p><p><i>Besides, all Elizabeth can think of just now is William. It has been three months since the nightmare of his smallpox and the effects&nbsp;. . . linger.</i><br></p><p> <br></p><p><i>Perhaps the resolution of North-umberland&#x2019;s fate will release us all from this sense that we are snared in the moment before action. The tension of waiting is almost more than I can bear.</i><br></p><p> <br></p><p>The trial of John Dudley, Duke of North-umberland, was presided over by George Boleyn, Duke of Roch-ford and Lord Chancellor of England. Traditionally, it was the Earl Marshal of England who conducted such trials, but William had delayed bestowing that hereditary office on the young Duke of Norfolk after his grandfather&#x2019;s death. Certainly Roch-ford did not appear to mind.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>While Dominic settled into place with the other peers who today would sit in judgment of North-umberland, his attention was almost wholly given over to contemplating Roch-ford himself. Three months ago the imprisoned Robert Dudley had made an enigmatic accusation aimed at the Lord Chancellor but had thus far refused to provide any details. Robert seemed to believe that even if his father were convicted today, William would be merciful as to the sentence and so there would continue to be time to consider the matter.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Dominic knew better.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>The doors at the back of the hall opened and North-umberland was escorted in. The hall at Westminster was a rich backdrop to today&#x2019;s trial. A stage had been erected in preparation, hung with tapestries and a canopy beneath which was a bench for North-umberland. Dominic viewed the tableau with a cynicism that he had learned from Roch-ford&#x2014;the trappings might argue respect for the accused, but they served primarily to remind those watching how far the man had fallen.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Now in his early fifties, North-umberland had always been the image of a rough, plainspoken outsider, his physical presence a reminder of his military prowess. But today he looked diminished, his high, broad forehead and dark pointed beard emphasizing rather than hiding the new gauntness of his face. He conducted himself with gravity, three times reverencing himself to the ground before the judges. Dominic thought wryly it was the most humility he&#x2019;d ever seen from John Dudley.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>The hall was crowded with spectators, including members of London City&#x2019;s guilds as well as diplomats and foreign merchants who would no doubt be taking careful notes and sending word of the proceedings far and wide across Europe. England had been the subject of intense Continental scrutiny for quite some time&#x2014;what with her young and untried king, her inflammatory religious divide, and her highly desirable and unwed royal princess. England might not be a powerhouse like France or Spain, but it was very often the critical piece that determined the balance of power.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>And now a peer of the realm was being tried for his life. Not to mention that a mere five months ago&#x2014;despite a peace treaty&#x2014; a French army had engaged English troops in battle on the Scots border, and since that time England&#x2019;s king had been mostly absent from public view. Everyone in England and Europe knew that William had been ill, and some correctly guessed at the smallpox that had driven him to seclusion. Now even his own people were beginning to grow restless. They had waited years for William to grow old enough to take his father&#x2019;s place as a reigning monarch. They were not content to leave the government in the hands of men like Roch-ford and North-umberland, rightly distrusting the motives of such powerful men. The people wanted their king.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>This trial was the first step in appeasing the public. North-umberland was hugely unpopular. Although Dominic had not been in London when the duke and four of his sons were paraded through the streets to the Tower, he had heard countless versions of how they were booed and mocked, pelted with rotten fruit and even stones. With William not quite ready to return to public view yet, North-umberland&#x2019;s trial for high treason was a distraction.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>It was also a sham. The original plan had been to have Parliament pass an Act of Attainder against North-umberland, avoiding a public trial and allowing the Crown to quickly confiscate the duke&#x2019;s lands. Granting him a trial instead in no way meant that North-umberland stood a chance of acquittal. There could be no doubt of the verdict; this trial was for the sole purpose of placating the populace.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Roch-ford opened the proceedings with a reading of the charges, none of which Dominic could dispute: the calculated secret marriage between North-umberland&#x2019;s son, Guildford, and Margaret Clifford, a cousin to the king and thus in line to England&#x2019;s throne. That disastrous marriage had been annulled after Margaret had given birth to a boy, but North-umberland&#x2019;s impudence could not be overlooked in the matter. And then there was the damning charge of <i>with intent and malice aforethought confining Her Highness, Princess Elizabeth, against her will</i>: Dominic had seen firsthand the duke&#x2019;s intent to keep hold of Elizabeth in his family castle until William agreed to listen to him. Related to that last was also the charge of raising troops against the king&#x2014;again indisputable. For the last two charges alone, North-umberland&#x2019;s life was forfeit.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>But Dominic was less easy about the other charges that had been considered behind the scenes. Charges that North-umberland had conspired to bring down the Howard family two years ago, that the duke had offered alliance with the Low Countries, even claiming in writing that Elizabeth would be a more amenable ruler than her brother&nbsp;. . . Dominic had been the one to find those damning letters in North-umberland&#x2019;s London home. He just wasn&#x2019;t sure how much he believed in them. Papers could be forged. Letters could be planted. Witnesses could be co-opted to a certain testimony. And it hadn&#x2019;t escaped his attention that those particular charges were not being tried in court today.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll keep it simple,&#x201d; Roch-ford had said. &#x201c;Leave out the messier aspects of North-umberland&#x2019;s behavior.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>And that was why Dominic kept a wary eye on Roch-ford. Because the messy aspects of this business were also the most open to other interpretations. More than eighteen months ago, the late Duke of Norfolk had died in the Tower after being arrested for attempting to brand the king a bastard and have his half sister, Mary, crowned queen. Dominic now believed, as most did, that the Duke of Norfolk&#x2019;s fall had been cleverly manipulated.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;What say you, John Dudley?&#x201d; Roch-ford asked after the reading of the charges.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;My Lord Chancellor,&#x201d; North-umberland responded, rising. His dark eyes, always alive with intelligence beneath the highly arched brows, looked at each juror in turn, and Dominic felt an unexpected grief at the imminent loss of this bright and capable man. &#x201c;My lords all,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;I say that my faults have ever only been those of a father. I acknowledge my pride and ambition, and humbly confess that those sins have led me to a state I do greatly regret. But I have not and could never compass a desire to wish or inflict harm upon His Most Gracious Majesty. My acts were those of a desperate father to a willful son. Guildford&#x2019;s death is greatly to be lamented, but I do desire nothing more at this time than to be reconciled to my king and his government.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>The presentation of evidence lasted only forty minutes; then North-umberland was led out of the hall and the jury retired to discuss their verdict. It took far less time than Dominic was comfortable with, and the outcome was never in doubt. Roch-ford and the twenty-year-old Duke of Norfolk (grandson of the man who had died in a false state of treasonable disgrace) were the most vehement of North-umberland&#x2019;s enemies, but every other lord on the jury had cause to resent the duke&#x2019;s arrogance and ambition. And as Dominic studied each man there, he was keenly aware of an undercurrent of fear, deeply hidden perhaps, but real. There was not a single peer present whose family title went further back than Henry VII&#x2019;s reign, and most of them had been ennobled by Henry VIII or William himself. The Tudors had broken the back of the old hereditary nobility, raising instead men whose power resulted from their personal loyalty and royal usefulness. It was true of Dominic himself&#x2014;the grandson of a king&#x2019;s daughter, perhaps, but in more practical terms only a son of a younger son with no land or title at all until William had granted them to him.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Or consider Roch-ford, Dominic thought, who might have been only a talented diplomat or secretary if his sister had not been queen.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>The problem with being raised up by personal loyalty was that one could as easily be unmade. And thus it was today&#x2014;the jury would find North-umberland guilty because William wished it as much as because it was right. And after all, Dominic would vote guilty without more than a slight qualm, for he had ridden through the midst of North-umberland&#x2019;s army last autumn and knew that it had been but a hairbreadth of pride and fear from open battle against the king.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>They returned to the hall and North-umberland stood to face the jury as, one after another, each member personally delivered his verdict. Dominic saw the glint of tears in North-umberland&#x2019;s eyes as Roch-ford pronounced the traditional sentence of a traitor&#x2014;to be hung, drawn, and quartered&#x2014;and concluded with, &#x201c;May God have mercy on your soul.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>There was open triumph in George Boleyn&#x2019;s voice.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Elizabeth was with her brother when Dominic and Roch-ford returned to Richmond to report on North-umberland&#x2019;s trial. They met the two dukes in the palace library, a chamber William would once have overlooked. Not that he wasn&#x2019;t well-read and intellectually curious, but before the smallpox that had nearly killed him at Christmas, William would more likely have been found playing cards or dice or tennis or riding through the royal park. Solitude and lassitude were new habits of the king.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Elizabeth studied her younger brother, noting worriedly that he had still not regained all the weight lost during his illness. William had always been tall and lean, but the hollows in his face were new, as was the paleness that could not be ascribed entirely to winter. The pallor of his face was accented by the carefully trimmed dark beard that made him look rather rakish in some lights. The beard was also new since the illness.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>The library was not entirely empty of others, but the half-dozen quiet attendants in the chamber were there in case of sudden need, not as entertainment. They kept to themselves at one end of the library, giving the royal siblings plenty of privacy.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>And of course, there was Minuette&#x2014;though these days one hardly needed to specify her presence. Wherever William might be, Minuette was at his side. The only place she didn&#x2019;t follow the king was his bed at night, and Elizabeth wondered how long that restraint would last. Since his illness, William&#x2019;s devotion to the childhood friend he&#x2019;d secretly betrothed had grown perilously near to obsession.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>When Roch-ford and Dominic entered the library, the Lord Chancellor dismissed the attendants, then offered his official report of North-umberland&#x2019;s conviction. William, seated beneath the col-ourful canopy of estate, received the news in frozen silence. Another lingering effect: his characteristic restlessness was often submerged beneath lengthy periods of stillness. When Roch-ford handed the king the execution order to sign, William took it without a word, almost as though he had no interest in the matter.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>It was Elizabeth who said, &#x201c;Thank you, Uncle.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>That stirred her brother enough to say flatly, &#x201c;You may go. Lord Exeter will return the order to you shortly.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Roch-ford gave them all a long, hard look&#x2014;lingering with disapproval on Minuette seated so near the king that she was almost beneath the royal canopy of estate. As William intended her to be. There was a time when Minuette would have looked uneasy at Roch-ford&#x2019;s fierce attention, but today she merely matched the chancellor&#x2019;s stare with one of her own. It almost made Elizabeth smile. Minuette might look demure and innocent&#x2014;in her gown of white and amber and with her honey-gold hair artfully arranged with jeweled combs&#x2014;but her devotion to William was absolute. She would not be cowed from doing what she thought best.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>And Roch-ford, for all his concern, was not ready to bring his discontent to open argument. Elizabeth knew it was coming&#x2014;this inner circle of just the four of them could not be allowed to last much longer&#x2014;but for today the Lord Chancellor held his tongue. He left them alone.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>They had always been exceptionally close: the &#x201c;Holy Quartet,&#x201d; Robert Dudley had named them. But since his brush with death, William had kept his sister, his love, and his friend even tighter around him. Was it for comfort? Elizabeth wondered. Or protection?<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Alone with those few he trusted absolutely, William stretched out his long legs in a gesture that made the tightness in Elizabeth&#x2019;s shoulders ease. She rejoiced with every moment that spoke of William as he had been before.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Sentenced to be hanged, disemboweled, and quartered,&#x201d; William said to Dominic, of North-umberland&#x2019;s fate. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll commute that to beheading, of course.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;You have nothing to plead else?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Elizabeth tightened again. They had not told William of Robert Dudley&#x2019;s plea to see her, of his claim that another man had as much to do with North-umberland&#x2019;s fall as his own actions. But despite their silence, William knew Dominic very well. Clearly he sensed there was more than just the usual caution behind his friend&#x2019;s reserve.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>But Dominic did not hesitate. &#x201c;North-umberland held Elizabeth and Minuette against their will in Dudley Castle. He raised an army that could only have been meant to be used against you. I have nothing to plead for him.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>William nodded, then stood and crossed to the table where pen and ink waited.

Profoundly poetic yet gloriously accessible, this is the best way to experience a work that has remained a centerpiece of Western civilization for 2,000 years. Fitzgerald&#39;s rendering speaks directly to the modern listener, inviting us to share the excitement, adventure, and human tears as Aeneas, the warrior hero, escapes from the burning city of Troy, embarks on a long and perilous journey, and eventually, triumphantly establishes a new nation: Rome.</p><p><i>Arma virumque cano</i>: "I sing of warfare and a man at war." Long the bane of second-year Latin students thrust into a rhetoric of sweeping, seemingly endless sentences full of difficult verb forms and obscure words, Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i> finds a helpful translator in Robert Fitzgerald, who turns the lines into beautiful, accessible American English. Full of betrayal, heartache, seduction, elation, and violence, the <i>Aeneid</i> is the great founding epic of the Roman empire. Its pages sing of the Roman vision of self, the Roman ideal of what it meant to be a citizen of the world's greatest power. The epic's force carries across the centuries, and remains essential reading.This book is the equal of its great Homeric predecessors, The Iliad and The Odyssey, in dramatic and narrative power, and it surpasses them in the intense sympathy which makes events such as the passion and destruction of Dido and the fall of Turnus among the most memorable in literature.</p><h2>My Husband&#39;s Wife: A Novel</h2><p><b><i><b>&#x201c;</b></i><b>[A] must-read thriller&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </b><i><b><i>My Husband&#x2019;s Wife</i> </b></i><b>has an ending that will change the way you view marriage forever.</b><i><b>&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Bustle</i></b><br><br> </i><b>&#x201c;If you loved <i>Gone Girl </i>and <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i>, you&#x2019;ll love <i>My Husband&#x2019;s Wife</i>.

Until recently, she was a tutor in creative writing at Oxford University.As I enter the gallery, I see the back of Ed&#x2019;s head.<br><br> &#x201c;Lily!&#x201d; He swivels round, saying my name as though it is fresh in his mouth. As if I am an acquaintance he hasn&#x2019;t seen for a long time instead of the wife he kissed good-bye this morning. &#x201c;Guess who walked into the gal�lery an hour ago?&#x201d;<br><br> As he speaks, a petite woman with a sleek black bob slides out from behind the pillar. Her hairstyle, apart from the color, is almost identical to mine. But she&#x2019;s young. Early twenties, at a guess. Big, wide, sunny smile with glossy bee-stung lips and a wide smooth forehead. She&#x2019;s stunning without being conventionally beautiful. Her face is the sort that makes you stare. I twist my silver bracelet&#x2014;the one I always wear&#x2014;with inexplicable nervousness.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, Lily!&#x201d; she sings. There&#x2019;s an unexpected kiss on both my cheeks. Then she stands back. I feel cold slice through me like a carving knife. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t remember me? It&#x2019;s Carla.&#x201d;<br><br> Carla? Little Carla who used to live in the same block of flats all those years ago, when Ed and I were first married? Carla, alias&nbsp;<i>The Italian Girl</i>? Is it really possible that this is the confident young woman who stands before me now with her immaculate complexion, her sharp, cat-like eyes accentu�ated with just the right touch of eyeliner is Carla?<br><br> It has taken me years to achieve a confidence like that.<br><br> But of course it&#x2019;s Carla. She&#x2019;s a mini-Francesca, minus the long curls.<br><br> &#x201c;How have you been?&#x201d; I manage to say. &#x201c;How is your mother?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This beautiful colt-like creature dips her chin and then tilts her head to one side as if considering the question. &#x201c;Mamma, she is very well, thank you. She is living in Italy. We have been there for some time.&#x201d;<br><br> Ed breaks in. &#x201c;Carla&#x2019;s been trying to get hold of us. She wrote to us.&#x201d;<br><br> I breathe steadily, just as I do in court when I need to be careful. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; I say.<br><br> It&#x2019;s not a lie. Just a question.<br><br> &#x201c;Twice,&#x201d; says Carla.<br><br> She is looking straight at me. Briefly I think back to that first letter with the Italian stamp, which was sent to our old address last year but forwarded to us by the current occupants.<br><br> My first instinct had been to throw it away like all the other begging let�ters we received around that time. People assume, rightly or wrongly, that if an artist has one big success, he or she is rich. The reality is that even with the portrait sale and Ed&#x2019;s trust money and my salary, we are still not that well off. Our mortgages on both the gallery and the house are huge. And of course we also have Tom&#x2019;s expensive therapy and his unknown future to think of.<br><br> I want to help people in need like any other decent person. But if you give to one, where do you stop? Yet Carla was different. She was right. In a way, we did owe our success to her.<br><br> I would talk to Ed, I decided. But a critic had just written yet another snide review, questioning why anyone would want to pay so much for a &#x201c;brash acrylic work that was worthy of a Montmartre street artist.&#x201d; My husband had been hurt. It was all I could do to assure Ed that this reviewer was wrong. Better to leave Carla&#x2019;s letter, I decided, until things were calmer.<br><br> Then came the second one, sent to the gallery where Ed had been exhib�iting temporarily before it had been forwarded to our home. Luckily, I happened to bump into the postman on the way to work. Recognizing the handwriting and foreign stamp, I slipped it in my briefcase and opened it in the office. The tone was angrier this time. More demanding. I sensed Fran�cesca&#x2019;s hand behind it. If we gave them some money, I thought, they might ask for more.<br><br> So I put it away, pretending to myself that I would deal with it at &#x201c;some point.&#x201d; And then I conveniently forgot about it. It wasn&#x2019;t the right thing to do. I can see that now. But if I had written back to Carla explaining our financial situation, she might not have believed it.<br><br> &#x201c;We were worried when you left so suddenly all those years ago,&#x201d; Ed is saying now. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you tell us you were going?&#x201d;<br><br> His question takes me back to the last time I saw Carla. That awful row between Tony, Francesca and me. On top of that, I was trying to work out if Ed and I should stay together.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I say, gritting my teeth, &#x201c;we <i>were </i>very worried about you.&#x201d; Then my eye falls on the painting behind her. It&#x2019;s hard not to. There are paintings of Carla as a child all over the room.<br> &#x201c;What do you think of your portraits?&#x201d; I ask. Might as well play devil&#x2019;s advocate, I tell myself. Try to draw Carla out. It would also make me look more innocent in the matter of those unanswered letters.<br><br> The young woman in front of me flushes. &#x201c;They are lovely.&#x201d; Then she flushes again. &#x201c;I do not mean that <i>I </i>am lovely, you understand&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, but you are,&#x201d; breaks in Ed. &#x201c;Such a beautiful child. We both thought so, didn&#x2019;t we, Lily?&#x201d;<br><br> I nod.</p><h2>Having Tea: Recipes &amp; Table Settings</h2><p>What could be cozier on a blustery winter's day than a mug of tea by the fire with freshly baked Irish soda bread slathered with sweet butter and tangy orange marmalade?

David Bellos was recently awarded the rank of officier in the Ordre National des Arts et des Lettres for his services to French culture.<b>Is That a Fish in Your Ear?</b><br><b>ONE</b><i>What Is a Translation?</i>Douglas Hofstadter took a great liking to this short poem by the sixteenth-century French wit Cl�ment Marot:<i>Ma mignonne,</i> <i>Je vous donne</i> <i>Le bon jour;</i> <i>Le s�jour</i> <i>C'est prison.</i> <i>Gu�rison</i> <i>Recouvrez,</i> <i>Puis ouvrez</i> <i>Votre porte</i> <i>Et qu'on sorte</i> <i>Vitement,</i> <i>Car Cl�ment</i> <i>Le vous mande.</i> <i>Va, friande</i> <i>De ta bouche,</i> <i>Qui se couche</i> <i>En danger</i> <i>Pour manger</i> <i>Confitures;</i><i>Si tu dures</i> <i>Trop malade,</i> <i>Couleur fade</i> <i>Tu prendras,</i> <i>Et perdras</i> <i>L'embonpoint.</i> <i>Dieu te doint</i> <i>Sant� bonne,</i> <i>Ma mignonne.</i>He sent a copy of it to a great number of his friends and acquaintances and asked them to translate it into English, respecting as well as they could the formal properties that he identified in it:(1) 28 lines (2) of 3 syllables each (3) in rhyming couplets (4) with the last line being the same as the first; (5) midway the poem changes from formal (<i>vous</i>) to informal (<i>tu</i>) and (6) the poet puts his own name directly into the poem.1Hofstadter, a cognitive scientist at Indiana University, got many dozens of responses over the following months and years. Each one of them was different, yet each one of them was without doubt a translation of Marot's little poem. By this simple device he demonstrated one of the most awkward and wonderful truths about translation. It is this: any utterance of more than trivial length has no one translation; all utterances have innumerably many acceptable translations.You get the same result with ordinary prose as you do with a poem. Give a hundred competent translators a page to translate, and the chances of any two versions being identical are close to zero. This fact about interlingual communication has persuaded many people that translation is not an interesting topic--because it is always approximate, it is just a second-rate kind of thing. That's why "translation" isn't the name of a long-established academic discipline, even though its practitioners have often been academics in some other field. How can you have theories and principles about a process that comes up with no determinate results?Like Hofstadter, I take the opposite view. The variability of translations is incontrovertible evidence of the limitless flexibility of human minds. There can hardly be a more interesting subject than that.What is it that translators really do? How many different kinds of translating are there? What do the uses of this mysterious ability tell us about human societies, past and present? How do the facts of translation relate to language use in general--and to what we think a language is?Those are the kinds of questions I explore in this book. Definitions, theories, and principles can be left aside until we have a better idea of what we are talking about. We shouldn't use them prematurely to decide whether the following version of Cl�ment Marot's poem (one of many by Hofstadter himself) is good, bad, or indifferent. It's the other way around. Until we can explain why the following version counts as a translation, we don't really know what we're saying when we utter the word.Gentle gem, Diadem, Ciao! Bonjour! Heard that you're In the rough: Glum, sub-snuff. Precious, tone Down your moan, And fling wideYour door; glide From your oy- ster bed, coy Little pearl. See, blue girl, Beet-red ru- by's your hue. For your aches, Carat cakes Are the cure. Eat no few'r Than fourteen, Silv'ry queen--But no more 'n twenty-four, Golden dream. How you'll gleam!

Amid the Parisian locales you know and love, unheard-of temptations abound. If your visit to the Cafe Conjugal ends in a spat, you can make up at the luscious and fantastic Museum of Lips and Books. From the disconcerting Brasserie Loplop, steal your chair for the Cinema Pont Neuf, whose movies flow onto the Seine. Your curiosity sated for the day, check into Hotel des Etrangers, where phantoms change the sheets and your room in the middle of the night. Unhandy glossaries help you talk your way through these provocative encounters, with such apropos comments as<i> J'aimerais sortir avec votre hyene pour boire un verre </i>(I'd like to take your hyena out for a drink). A rare and rowdy entertainment that dares its readers to explore a Paris one can only wish existed.</p><p>Nick Bantock is the author of numerous illustrated novels, including Griffin &amp; Sabine , Sabine's Notebook , The Golden Mean , The Gryphon , and Alexandria , which together spent 100 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list.

His tale starts with a birthday cake for his dear old granny, a bad head cold and a bad reputation.</p><p>Did the story of the three little pigs ever seem slightly biased to you? All that huffing and puffing--could one wolf really be so unequivocally evil? Finally, we get to hear the rest of the story, "as told to author Jon Scieszka," straight from the wolf's mouth. As Alexander T. Wolf explains it, the whole Big Bad Wolf thing was just a big misunderstanding. Al Wolf was minding his own business, making his granny a cake, when he realized he was out of a key ingredient. He innocently went from house to house to house (one made of straw, one of sticks, and one of bricks) asking to borrow a cup of sugar. Could he help it if he had a bad cold, causing him to sneeze gigantic, gale-force sneezes? Could he help it if pigs these days use shabby construction materials? And after the pigs had been ever-so-accidentally killed, well, who can blame him for having a snack?<p> As with <i>The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales</i>, (another stellar collaboration by Scieszka and illustrator Lane Smith), children who know all the old stories by heart will delight in reading impudent new versions. Here, Scieszka's text is clever, savvy, and tabloid-quick, and Smith's stretchy-strange illustrations complete this funny, irreverent, thoroughly original tale. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i></p><b>From the desk of Lane Smith:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b> <br> &nbsp; <br> "A lot of reviewers have misidentified my technique as airbrush or dyes or even egg tempera. I think this is because it almost looks as if it was sprayed with paint with little dots of color and texture visible. Actually, my work is rendered in oil paints. I paint on board, building up several thin glazes of the oil, sealing them between coats with an acrylic spray varnish. This not only dries the oil instantly, but also causes a chemical reaction between the oil and the acrylic. Normally, it would be a mistake to combine two opposites like this and in fact it was a mistake the first time I did it, but I liked the results. I'm a big fan of artists who play with surfaces. I love texture and grunge. The trick is to know when to stop. Sometimes I keep adding more and more layers until I've ruined the piece. Usually I stop when the painting starts to look interesting. Then I go in with a fine brush and add details, lights and darks, etc. It's a laborious process, but it's unpredictable and it keeps me interested and surprised. Of course, I'm influenced by other illustrators too, like N.C. Wyeth, Maurice Sendak, Arthur Rackham, Edward Lear, Gustav Dore and Tomi Ungerer. I hope I can follow the path these dark illustrators have walked, or at least use the sidewalk that runs alongside it."</p><h2>Following the Phoenix (Letzenstein Chronicles)</h2><p>In 1848 as the February Revolution erupts in Paris, Rafael le Marre finds himself responsible for leading three companions on a dangerous journey from Paris to Letzenstein.</p><p><p><b>Meriol Trevor</b>&nbsp;(1919- 2000) was educated at St. Hugh's College, Oxford.

With poetic flair and a sense of humor, Masumoto offers his perspectives on the joys and frustrations of raising and tending peaches and grapes. He describes his relationship with the weeds and insects that invade his fields, the unpredictability of the weather, his desire to treat workers fairly, and the realities of the market structure. Reading about Masumoto's attempts to produce high-quality peaches and his fears that rain at the wrong time will destroy his drying grapes will be a truly educational experience for those not familiar with the complexities of farming. Masumoto observes with awe the diversity of nature over four seasons and his family's obligation to plan their lives around the seasons. Many books about family farms today present an image of economic and social distress, but this work portrays the positive aspects as told by a farmer who enjoys his work.

I&#x2019;d finish seventh grade far away from the rest of my class and turn in the last of my assignments by mail.<br>Before we left, Dad and I packed for three days straight. We taped over the seams of a couple-dozen cardboard boxes, then shipped them away on a cargo plane, and drove north. We were leaving behind our house in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, which was far enough north already in my mind, considering it was only about a five-hour drive to the Canadian line. But one mile-marker at a time, we went right on over the border toward Churchill, Manitoba.<br>I&#x2019;d never crossed the border before. It&#x2019;s all very official and serious. Men and women in uniform with stern faces and clipped questions, and the Canadian flag flying high over the border station made me nervous. Guilty. Like maybe the stuff we were taking into Canada might be illegal or something. But all I had in my pockets was some Chapstick and a candy wrapper. Our duffle bags were just full of clothes, and I guess we must not have looked too suspicious because they didn&#x2019;t ask us to get out of our vehicle for a search or anything.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The border patrol has an interesting job, I think. All the pictures they look at every day&#x2014;how many driver&#x2019;s licenses and passport pictures do they see?<br>The photo on my passport wasn&#x2019;t great. I looked too excited about getting my picture taken. My eyes were wide and there was a surprised look on my face. I looked like I thought my whole life was bound to be one big unexpected thing after another. But I don&#x2019;t like change too much, or the unexpected, and it was frustrating that Dad somehow thought all this was a good idea in the first place. Nobody drags their kid to the arctic for the summer. But my Dad was, and it was surprising how fast my entire life suddenly felt unsteady. Like one big gust of arctic wind could sweep it all away.<br>Of course, the border patrolman didn&#x2019;t care about any of that. He just asked for my name and matched it to the name printed on my identification. And if he noticed the funny look on my face at all, he probably just thought the lady at the passport office had been quick with her snap-shot finger.<br>&#x201c;What are you doing in Manitoba?&#x201d; the patrolman asked.<br>&#x201c;Whale research,&#x201d; Dad said. And I was thankful he left it at that, because once he got started talking about whales, there&#x2019;d be no stopping him.<br>The patrolman waved us through, and I turned around in my seat, watching as the gate lowered behind us. The border station shrunk smaller and smaller as we drove. The road pulled us away from that invisible border line separating the United States from Canada&#x2014;separating home from everything else. And when I finally turned back around in my seat, it felt like we were going in reverse because I&#x2019;d been watching the road move away from us for so long. That&#x2019;s what leaving is like. Watching things slip away from you until your insides ache and everything feels backwards.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dad and I drove until we reached Montreal, where a man waited to buy our truck. &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We won&#x2019;t be able to drive past Thompson, Manitoba,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;No one can, because the roads actually end. And there&#x2019;s no point in having a truck you can&#x2019;t use.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s practical like that.<br>After Thompson, the roads leading north just stop, giving way to Arctic peat bogs and ocean inlets. I&#x2019;d spent the past few weeks poring over the pictures I&#x2019;d found online, trying to see it all in my head&#x2014;something I could barely imagine. I tried to picture the bog lakes and stretches of Tamarack trees. In the fall, the trees would trade their green summery clothes for needles the color of saffron&#x2014;a spice Mom kept in a small glass jar in the spice rack. &nbsp;<br>But winter was still in charge where we were headed. In the Arctic, things stay cold a whole lot longer than other places. It&#x2019;s too far north to thaw when farther south everything is getting on with the business of spring.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Montreal man who bought our truck seemed nice enough, though I don&#x2019;t remember very much about him. The only thing that really stuck in my mind, was his hair. It sprouted wildly out of his head, and once in a while he ran a hand through it, trying to calm it down. But it wouldn&#x2019;t be calmed and kept falling into his face where it got mixed up in his eyebrows. There was even hair coming out of his ears, and poking up through his dirty flannel shirt where he&#x2019;d left it unbuttoned, and though I tried to ignore it, out of his nose, too.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d care who bought our truck. But when it came right down to it, I did. I guess I&#x2019;d envisioned people like us having the Ford and somehow, I couldn&#x2019;t make this man and whatever family he might have fit that picture. It made saying good-bye to the old green truck even harder than I thought it&#x2019;d be. Strange, how you can get attached to something that&#x2019;s done nothing but carry you from one place to the next.<br>The Ford had carried me to school on snow days when Mom and Dad didn&#x2019;t trust the buses.<br>It had carried us to Dairy Queen on hot summer nights. Dad would let me ride in the back, just as long as I sat down and leaned against the cab. He would take the back roads and roll the windows down so that his country music could pour out into the summer air. Mom would sing along, letting the wind carry her voice. She always opened the back window so I could sing along, too, and she held my hand through the space there, like she was afraid I&#x2019;d blow away in all that warm summer wind.<br>And of course, the Ford took us to the hospital and back, over and over again, when Mom got sick.<br>But we left the Ford behind, along with all those memories, and boarded a plane that would bring us closer to dad&#x2019;s whales. We would have to take two of them: a big plane from Montreal to Winnipeg, and a smaller one from Winnipeg to Churchill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as our plane bounced once before lurching into Canadian skies, I wondered what would be carrying me around next.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Third Jesus: The Christ We Cannot Ignore</h2><p>Who is Jesus Christ? <br><br>In <i>The Third Jesus</i>, bestselling author and spiritual leader Deepak Chopra provides an answer to this question that is both a challenge to current systems of belief and a fresh perspective on what Jesus can teach us all, regardless of our religious background. There is not one Jesus, Chopra writes, but three.<br><br>First, there is the historical Jesus, the man who lived more than two thousand years ago and whose teachings are the foundation of Christian theology and thought. Next there is Jesus the Son of God, who has come to embody an institutional religion with specific dogma, a priesthood, and devout believers. And finally, there is the third Jesus, the cosmic Christ, the spiritual guide whose teaching embraces all humanity, not just the church built in his name. He speaks to the individual who wants to find God as a personal experience, to attain what some might call grace, or God-consciousness, or enlightenment. <br><br>When we take Jesus literally, we are faced with the impossible. How can we truly &#x201c;love thy neighbor as thyself&#x201d;? But when we see the exhortations of Jesus as invitations to join him on a higher spiritual plane, his words suddenly make sense.<br><br>Ultimately, Chopra argues, Christianity needs to overcome its tendency to be exclusionary and refocus on being a religion of personal insight and spiritual growth. In this way Jesus can be seen for the universal teacher he truly is&#x2013;someone whose teachings of compassion, tolerance, and understanding can embrace and be embraced by all of us.</p><p>DEEPAK CHOPRA, a member of Oprah's SuperSoul 100, is the author of more than fifty books translated into over thirty-five languages, including numerous <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers in both the fiction and non-fiction categories. Chopra&#x2019;s Wellness Radio <br> airs weekly on Sirius Satellite Stars, Channel 102, which focuses on the areas of success, love, sexuality and relationships, well-being, and spirituality. He is founder and president of the Alliance for a New Humanity. <i>Time</i> magazine heralds Deepak Chopra as one of the top one hundred heroes and icons of the century and credits him as &#x201c;the poet-prophet of alternative medicine.&#x201d; <br><br> www.deepakchopra.comRedeeming the Redeemer<br><br>Jesus is in trouble. When people worship him today--or even speak his name--the object of their devotion is unlikely to be who they think he is. A mythical Jesus has grown up over time. He has served to divide peoples and nations. He has led to destructive wars in the name of religious fantasies. The legacy of love found in the New Testament has been tainted with the worst sort of intolerance and prejudice that would have appalled Jesus in life. Most troubling of all, his teachings have been hijacked by people who hate in the name of love.<br><br>"Sometimes I feel this social pressure to return to my faith," a lapsed Catholic told me recently, "but I'm too bitter. Can I love a religion that calls gays sinners but hides pedophiles in its clergy? Yesterday while I was driving to work, I heard a rock song that went, 'Jesus walked on water when he should have surfed,' and you know what? I burst out laughing. I would never have done that when I was younger. Now I feel only the smallest twinge of guilt."<br><br>No matter where you look, a cloud of confusion hangs over the message of Jesus. To cut through it we have to be specific about who we mean when we refer to Jesus. One Jesus is historical, and we know next to nothing about him. Another Jesus is the one appropriated by Christianity. He was created by the Church to fulfill its agenda. The third Jesus, the one this book is about, is as yet so unknown that even the most devout Christians don't suspect that he exists. Yet he is the Christ we cannot--and must not--ignore.<br><br>The first Jesus was a rabbi who wandered the shores of northern Galilee many centuries ago. This Jesus still feels close enough to touch. He appears in our mind's eye dressed in homespun but haloed in glory. He was kind, serene, peaceful, loving, and yet he was the keeper of deep mysteries.<br><br>This historical Jesus has been lost, however, swept away by history. He still lingers like a ghost, a projection of all the ideal qualities we wish for in ourselves but so painfully lack. Why couldn't there be one person who was perfectly loving, perfectly compassionate, and perfectly humble? There can be if we call him Jesus and remove him to a time thousands of years in the past. (If you live in the East, his name might be Buddha, but the man is equally mythical and equally a projection of our own lack.)<br><br>The first Jesus is less than consistent, as a closer reading of the gospels will show. If Jesus was perfectly peaceful, why did he declare, "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword"? (Matthew 10:34) If he was perfectly loving, why did he say, "Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth"? (Matthew 25:30) (Sometimes the translation is even harsher, and Jesus commands "the worthless slave" to be consigned to hell.) If Jesus was humble, why did he claim to rule the earth beyond the power of any king? At the very least, the living Jesus was a man of baffling contradictions.<br><br>And yet the more contradictions we unearth, the less mythical this Jesus becomes. The flesh-and-blood man who is lost to history must have been extraordinarily human. To be divine, one must be rich in every human quality first. As one famous Indian spiritual teacher once said, "The measure of enlightenment is how comfortable you feel with your own contradictions."<br><br>Millions of people worship another Jesus, however, who never existed, who doesn't even lay claim to the fleeting substance of the first Jesus. This is the Jesus built up over thousands of years by theologians and other scholars. He is the Holy Ghost, the Three-in-One Christ, the source of sacraments and prayers that were unknown to the rabbi Jesus when he walked the earth. He is also the Prince of Peace over whom bloody wars have been fought. This second Jesus cannot be embraced without embracing theology first. Theology shifts with the tide of human affairs. Metaphysics itself is so complex that it contradicts the simplicity of Jesus's words. Would he have argued with learned divines over the meaning of the Eucharist? Would he have espoused a doctrine declaring that babies are damned until they are baptized?<br><br>The second Jesus leads us into the wilderness without a clear path out. He became the foundation of a religion that has proliferated into some twenty thousand sects. They argue endlessly over every thread in the garments of a ghost. But can any authority, however exalted, really inform us about what Jesus would have thought? Isn't it a direct contradiction to hold that Jesus was a unique creation--the one and only incarnation of God--while at the same time claiming to be able to read his mind on current events? Yet in his name Christianity pronounces on homosexuality, birth control, and abortion.<br><br>These two versions of Jesus--the sketchy historical figure and the abstract theological creation--hold a tragic aspect for me, because I blame them for stealing something precious: the Jesus who taught his followers how to reach God-consciousness. I want to offer the possibility that Jesus was truly, as he proclaimed, a savior. Not the savior, not the one and only Son of God. Rather, Jesus embodied the highest level of enlightenment. He spent his brief adult life describing it, teaching it, and passing it on to future generations.<br><br>Jesus intended to save the world by showing others the path to God-consciousness.<br><br>Such a reading of the New Testament doesn't diminish the first two Jesuses. Rather, they are brought into sharper focus. In place of lost history and complex theology, the third Jesus offers a direct relationship that is personal and present. Our task is to delve into scripture and prove that a map to enlightenment exists there. I think it does, undeniably; indeed, it's the living aspect of the gospels. We aren't talking about faith. Conventional faith is the same as belief in the impossible (such as Jesus walking on water), but there is another faith that gives us the ability to reach into the unknown and achieve transformation.<br><br>Jesus spoke of the necessity to believe in him as the road to salvation, but those words were put into his mouth by followers writing decades later. The New Testament is an interpretation of Jesus by people who felt reborn but also left behind. In orthodox Christianity they won't be left behind forever; at the Second Coming Jesus will return to reclaim the faithful. But the Second Coming has had twenty centuries to unfold, with the devout expecting it any day, and still it lies ahead. The idea of the Second Coming has been especially destructive to Jesus's intentions, because it postpones what needs to happen now. The Third Coming--finding God-consciousness through your own efforts--happens in the present. I'm using the term as a metaphor for a shift in consciousness that makes Jesus's teachings totally real and vital.<br><br>When Jesus Comes Again<br><br>Imagine for a moment that you are one of the poor Jewish farmers, fishermen, or other heavy laborers who have heard about a wandering rabbi who promises Heaven, not to the rich and powerful, but to your kind, society's humblest. On this day--we can surmise that it was hot and dry, with the desert sun beating down from overhead--you climb a hill north of the blue inland lake known as the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>At the top of the hill Jesus sits with his closest followers, waiting to preach until enough people have gathered. You wait, too, seeking the shade of the crooked olive trees that dot the parched landscape. Jesus (known to you in Hebrew as Yeshua, a fairly common name) delivers a sermon, and you are deeply struck, to the heart, in fact. He promises that God loves you, a statement he makes directly, without asking you to follow the duties of your sect or to respect the ancient, complex laws of the prophets. Further, he says that God loves you best. In the world to come, you and your kind will get the richest rewards, everything you have been denied in this world.<br><br>The words sound idealistic to the point of lunacy--if God loved you so much, why did he saddle you with cruel Roman conquerors? Why did he allow you to be enslaved and forced to toil until the day you die? The priests in Jerusalem have explained this many times: As the son of Adam, your sins have brought you a wretched existence, full of misery and endless toil. But Jesus doesn't mention sin. He expands God's love to unbelievable lengths. Did you really hear him right?<br><br>You are the light of the world. Let your light shine before all men.<br><br>He compares you to a city set upon a hill that can't be hidden because its lights are so bright. You've never been told anything remotely like this or ever seen yourself this way.<br><br>Don't judge others, so that you may not be judged. Before you try to take a mote out of your brother's eye, first remove the log from your own.<br><br>Do to others what you would have them do to you. This one rule sums up what the law and the prophets taught.<br><br>Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and the door will open.<br><br>How can you explain your reaction to this preacher--jumbled feelings of disbelief and hope, suspicion and an aching need to believe? You wanted to run away before he was finished, denying everything you heard. No sane man could walk the streets and judge not the thieves, pickpockets, and whores on every corner. It was absurd to claim that all you had to do, if you needed bread and clothes, was to ask God for them. And yet how beautifully Jesus wove the spell:<br><br>Consider the lilies, how they grow: They neither toil nor spin, but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. Consider the crows, for they neither sow nor reap, they have no storeroom or barn, and yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds!<br><br>Despite years of hard experience that made a lie of Jesus's promises, you believed them while you were listening. You kept believing them as you walked back down the hill near sunset, and for a few days afterward they haunted you. Until they faded away.<br><br>Time hasn't altered this mixture of hope and puzzlement. I had an experience that centers around one of Jesus's most baffling teachings: "Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also." (Luke 6:29) These are words that our Jewish laborer could have heard that day on the hilltop, but time hasn't altered human nature enough to make this teaching any easier. If I let a bully hit me on one cheek only to turn the other, won't he beat the stuffing out of me? The same holds good, on a larger scale, for a threat like terrorism: If we allow evildoers to strike us without reprisal, won't they continue to do so, over and over?<br><br>On the surface my experience only vaguely fits this dilemma. Yet it leads to the heart of Christ's mission. I was in a crowded bookstore promoting a new book when a woman came up to me, saying, "Can I talk to you? I need three hours." She was a compact, forceful person (less politely, a pit bull), but as gently as I could I told her, pointing to the other people crowded around the table, that I didn't have three hours to spare.<br><br>A cloud passed over her face. "You have to. I came all the way from Mexico City," she said, insisting that she must have three hours alone with me. I asked if she had called my office in advance, and she had. What did they tell her? That I would be busy all day.<br><br>"But I came on my own anyway, because I've heard you say that anything is possible," she said. "If that's true, you should be able to see me."<br><br>The PR person in charge of the event was pulling at my elbow, so I told the woman that if she came back later, I might find a few minutes of personal time for her. She became enraged in front of everyone. She released a stream of invective, sparing no four-letter words, and stalked away, muttering darkly that I was a fraud. Later that night the incident wouldn't leave me in peace, so I considered an essential spiritual truth: People mirror back to us the reality of who we are. I sat down and wrote out a list of things I'd noticed about this woman. What had I disliked about her? She was angry, demanding, confrontational, and selfish. Then I called my wife and asked her if I was like that. There was a long silence at the other end of the phone. I was more than a little shaken.<br><br>I sat down to face what reality was asking me to face. I found a veneer of annoyance and irritation (after all, wasn't I the innocent victim? hadn't she embarrassed me in front of dozens of people?). Then I called a truce with the negative energies she had stirred up. Vague images of past injuries came to mind, which put me on the right trail. I moved as much of the stagnant energies of hurt as I could.<br><br>To put it bluntly, this was a Jesus moment. When he preached, "If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer him the other also" (Luke 6:29), Jesus wasn't preaching masochism or martyrdom. He was speaking of a quality of consciousness that is known in Sanskrit as Ahimsa. The word is usually translated as "harmlessness" or "nonviolence," and in modern times it became the watchword of Gandhi's movement of peaceful resistance. Gandhi himself was often seen as Christlike, but Ahimsa has roots in India going back thousands of years.<br><br>In the Indian tradition several things are understood about nonviolence, and all of them apply to Jesus's version of turning the other cheek. First, the aim of nonviolence is ultimately to bring peace to yourself, to quell your own violence; the enemy outside serves only to mirror the enemy within. Second, your ability to be nonviolent depends on a shift in consciousness. Last, if you are successful in changing yourself, reality will mirror the change back to you.<br><br>Without these conditions, Ahimsa isn't spiritual or even effective. If someone full of desire for retaliation turns the other cheek to someone equally enraged, the only thing that will occur is more violence. Playing the part of a saint won't make a difference. But if a person in God-consciousness turns the other cheek, his enemy will be disarmed.</p><h2>Ed Emberley&#39;s Picture Pie: A Circle Drawing Book</h2><p>By cutting a circle in pie-shaped wedges, then following the simple examples provided by this book, youngsters can master this innovative approach to art</p><p>Ed Emberley is the Caldecott Award-winning author of the popular Drawing Book series, as well as the best-selling Go Away, Big Green Monster!

This richly illustrated book, the first edition of which was published before Taymor's Broadway triumph, has now been expanded to include The Lion King and other recent Taymor productions, including The Flying Dutchman, The Green Bird, and her forthcoming film of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, starring Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.<p>Award-winning theater critic Eileen Blumenthal traces Taymor's background and achievements in theater, opera, and film. Taymor herself provides notes on each of her projects, along with her original drawings for costumes and characters.j</p></p><p>Most people know the work of theater director Julie Taymor, if they know it at all, from her hit adaptation of Walt Disney's <i>The Lion King</i> for the Broadway stage. But this gorgeous book, a pictorial history of the artist's career, demonstrates that for the past 25 years Taymor has been creating original works of theater that combine a stunning visual sense with an extensive knowledge of the performance styles of many countries outside the West. Theater critic and scholar Eileen Blumenthal has followed the work of Taymor almost since its very beginnings, and her lengthy critical assessment of this inspired artist's work combines interviews with the director with a cogent analysis of her intellectual development and cultural sources. <p> From her days as a teenager studying the people and theater of Bali to her travels in Japan, Europe, and then back to New York, Taymor has reveled in the cross-fertilization of different images and ideas from a wide variety of countries. Her critically lauded piece <i>The Transposed Heads</i>, for example, was adapted from a Thomas Mann novella that was itself based on an ancient Indian folktale. Unlike most directors, Taymor came from the world of the designer, and it was her exquisite work creating costumes, masks, and puppets that first launched her into work in the theater. But gradually she gained the respect of actors as well, and now is regarded as a director of uncommon sensitivity, who can pull performances from a cast that match in intensity her phenomenal visual eye. </p><p> Lavishly illustrated with color and black and white photographs, this is a fitting tribute to a woman who, still in her 40s, is nothing short of a theatrical prodigy. As Taymor moves further into the world of commercial theater and film (her upcoming cinematic production of <i>Titus</i>, starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange and adapted from her own stage production of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, opens soon), more audiences than ever will be treated to her extraordinary work. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i></p>Since the first edition of this work appeared in 1995, Julie Taymor's fame as one of the world's most imaginative theatrical director/designers has expanded beyond avant-garde cognescenti to the general public with her mega-hit Broadway adaptation of Disney's The Lion King and, most recently, her first feature film, Titus, based on the bloodiest of Shakespeare's tragedies. Still in her forties, Taymor is the recipient of a MacArthur "genius" grant and the first woman to win a Tony Award for directing. Theater critic Blumenthal's excellent introductory essay tracing Taymor's early theatrical influences is followed by shorter, heavily illustrated production histories of her major productions, from Way of Snow (1974) through Titus (1999). This updated edition is published to coincide with a major retrospective exhibition of her design work traveling from Columbus, OH, to North Adams, MA; Washington, DC; and Chicago. It is easily the most accessible introduction to Taymor available, appropriate and recommended for all public and academic library theater collections.<br><i>-Robert W.

Loewen continues his mission, begun in the award-winning <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i>, of overturning the myths and misinformation that too often pass for American history. This is a one-of-a-kind examination of sites all over the country where history is literally written on the landscape, including historical markers, monuments, historic houses, forts, and ships. With entries drawn from each of the fifty states, Loewen reveals that: <br> <ul> <li>The USS Intrepid, the &#x201c;feel-good&#x201d; war museum, celebrates its glorious service in World War II but nowhere mentions the three tours it served in Vietnam.</li> <li>The Jefferson Memorial misquotes from the Declaration of Independence and skews Jefferson&#x2019;s writings to present this conflicted slave owner as a near abolitionist.</li> <li>Abraham Lincoln had been dead for thirty years when his birthplace cabin was built.</li></ul><br><i>Lies Across America</i> is a reality check for anyone who has ever sought to learn about America through the nation&#x2019;s public sites and markers. Entertaining and enlightening, it is destined to change the way American readers see their country.</p><p>Little seems to delight historian James W. Loewen, author of <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i>, more than picking apart the cherished myths of American history. Few Americans study history after high school--instead, Loewen writes, they turn to novels and Oliver Stone movies to learn about the past. And they turn to the landscape, to roadside historical markers, guidebooks, museums, and tours of battlefields, childhood homes, and massacre sites. If you were to trust those sources, Loewen suggests, you would learn, erroneously, that the first airplane flight took place not at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, but at Pittsburg, Texas. "It must be true--an impressive-looking Texas state historical marker says so!" Loewen chortles. <p> In these entertaining pages, Loewen takes a region-by-region tour of the United States, pointing out historical oddments as he travels. For example, a massacre of white pioneers by Indians commemorated in Almo, Idaho, never took place, Loewen continues; neither did many other such events. Indeed, he insists, "throughout the entire West between 1842 and 1859, of more than 400,000 pioneers crossing the plains, fewer than 400, or less than .1 percent, were killed by American Indians." And if you were to visit Helen Keller's Georgia birthplace, over which a Confederate flag flies, you would get the impression that Keller had been an unreconstructed daughter of the Old South, whereas she was in fact an early supporter of the NAACP. And so on.</p><p> After finishing Loewen's alternately angry and bemused expos�, readers will likely never trust a roadside historical marker or tour guide again--which may prompt them to turn to history books to check things out for themselves. As well they should. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>James W.

But now her father-in-law lies murdered, and her husband has vanished. There's no one Emma can turn to for help but Emily, who leaves at once with her husband, the dashing Colin Hargreaves, for Venice. There, her investigations take her from opulent palazzi to slums, libraries, and bordellos. Emily soon realizes that to solve the present day crime, she must first unravel a centuries old puzzle. But the past does not give up its secrets easily, especially when these revelations might threaten the interests of some very powerful people.</p></p><p>The daughter of two philosophy professors, I grew up surrounded by books. I was convinced from an early age that I was born in the wrong century and spent much of my childhood under the dining room table pretending it was a covered wagon. Even there, I was never without a book in hand and loved reading and history more than anything. I studied English Literature and Medieval History at the University of Notre Dame. Writing is a natural offshoot of reading, and my first novel,&nbsp;<i>And Only to Deceive</i>, was published in 2005. I'm the New York Times Bestselling author of the long-running Lady Emily Series as well as the novel&nbsp;<i>Elizabeth: The Golden Age</i>. One of the best parts of being an author is seeing your books translated, and I'm currently in love with the Japanese editions of the Emily books.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I played nomad for a long time, living in Indiana, Amsterdam, London, Wyoming, Vermont, Connecticut, and Tennessee before settling down. My husband, the brilliant British novelist&nbsp;Andrew Grant&nbsp;(I may be biased but that doesn't mean I'm wrong) and I now divide our time between Chicago and Wyoming. He makes sure I get my English characters right, and I make sure his American ones sound American.<b>1</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d expected jewel encrusted, not encased in a layer of dried blood.&#x201d; Almost cringing, I fingered the slim medieval dagger that felt heavier in my hands than its size suggested.<br>Tourists come to Venice, the city Petrarch called <i>mundus alter,</i> &#x201c;another world,&#x201d; to take in the opulent beauty of the floating city&#x2019;s palaces, the soft colors and vibrant gold of St. Mark&#x2019;s Basilica, and the rich elegance of Titian&#x2019;s paintings. My trip, however, came without the prospect of such pleasant things. I was standing in a dark, musty palazzo with my childhood nemesis glowering over my shoulder as I inspected the knife an intruder had used to kill her father-in-law. An unpleasant sensation prickled up my neck as I stared down. Instruments of murder are not something with which a lady contends on a daily basis. Particularly not one still bearing evidence of its evil use.<br>&#x201c;The police returned it to me in just that condition,&#x201d; Emma Callum said, wrinkling her nose. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t about to touch it. And the servants point-blank refused to clean it. I&#x2019;d fire the lot of them if my Italian were better.&#x201d;<br>I liked to believe the majority of my fellow countrymen were excellent travelers abroad. Credits to the empire. An Englishman ought to conduct himself in a manner more likely to draw admiration than scorn, and should use his explorations of the world as an opportunity to expand his mind and improve his character. Emma showed no sign of such aspirations, a condition unusual in someone who has chosen to go beyond simple tourist and embrace the life of an expat. Then again, Emma had lived in Italy for three years without bothering even to learn the language.<br>My husband took the knife from my hand and studied it before laying it on a table. We&#x2019;d been married just over two years, and Colin Hargreaves still took my breath away every time I looked at his preternaturally handsome face. Early on in our acquaintance (even before I&#x2019;d abandoned my erroneous suspicion that he&#x2019;d murdered my first husband&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s another story altogether), I&#x2019;d decided his perfectly chiseled features looked as if Praxiteles, my favorite ancient Greek artist, had sculpted them. His dark eyes and darker wavy hair lent him a romantic air that would set Mr. Darcy to permanent brooding and send Heathcliff stalking across the moors, never to return. No man, fictional or real, could compare.<br>Our hostess, however, was an entirely different matter. One might, perhaps, compare Emma to Miss Bingley or Mrs. Dashwood, but she did not quite reach the level of a great villain of literature. Still, nothing short of murder could have induced me to renew my acquaintance with Emma. We had never been close, and it was unlikely this would ever change. Put simply, she despised me, and I&#x2019;m ashamed to admit I returned the feeling. When we were six years old, she destroyed my favorite doll, smashing its porcelain face with her boot. She scooped up the pitiful remains of the toy my father had specially brought for me from Paris and ran downstairs from the nursery to the conservatory where our mothers were having tea.<br>I will never forget the way the conservatory looked that day, the way the sunlight filtered through the leaves of my mother&#x2019;s precious lemon trees, and the scent of bright lilies, which forever after would seem to me heavy and cloying. Emma held out her bounty, her eyes wide with horror, and spoke, her voice trembling.<br>&#x201c;Look at the terrible thing Emily has done,&#x201d; she said. From where she conjured her tears, I know not, but her voice grew even more pathetic as she continued. &#x201c;I told her the dolly was pretty, but she insisted she wanted one with better curls. So she stepped on her. Crushed her head in with her foot and said now she knew she&#x2019;d get a new one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did she?&#x201d; My mother&#x2019;s face was inscrutable, but I knew the trouble I was in for.<br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t seem right,&#x201d; Emma said. &#x201c;To destroy something only to be rewarded.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can assure you, Emma, that will not happen.&#x201d;<br>When I woke up the next morning, all my remaining dolls had disappeared from the nursery, and there was never another one seen in the house.<br>I knew better than to tattle and didn&#x2019;t even try to defend myself. Any attempt to do so would have been met with even more trouble. Emma and I continued to be thrown together throughout childhood due to our mothers&#x2019; friendship, but I refused to engage in any but the most basic interaction with her. She did not improve with age. As a debutante, she barraged with attention any gentleman who showed even the slightest interest in me, culminating with a clumsy attempt to wrangle Philip, the Viscount Ashton and at the time my soon-to-be-fianc�, away from me.<br>It was unlikely our acquaintance would ever grow into a real friendship.<br>Now Emma needed me, and I was not about to walk away from her, despite our past. Her father-in-law had been murdered, and her husband had disappeared shortly thereafter, an act that, so far as the authorities were concerned, proved his guilt. She sent for me, begging for help. This, in itself, was proof of how desperate she was feeling.<br>Seeking our assistance was no rash act on Emma&#x2019;s part. My husband, an agent of the Crown, had a reputation for his ability to crack any investigation with his trademark discretion. And I, if I may be so bold as to give myself such a compliment, had proven my own mettle after successfully apprehending six notorious murderers. As a result, the day after reading her panicked wire, my husband and I traveled to Venice and, almost immediately upon our arrival, climbed into a boat and glided out of the slim canal that skimmed the side of the Hotel Danieli. The gondolier rowed us under a single bridge and into the lagoon before turning into the Grand Canal. Sunlight poured around us, its reflection dancing over the ornate facades of the buildings that rose, majestic, straight from the water. We passed the domed church of Santa Maria della Salute, built in the seventeenth century to give thanks for the end of the plague that had killed upwards of a hundred thousand people in the city, and we crossed under the Ponte della Carita, to my mind the ugliest bridge in the city. It was made from iron, did not have a graceful arching form like the famous stone bridges prevalent throughout Venice, and had been placed too low over the water, making it difficult for gondoliers during high tide. Around us, the canal was crowded with boats, the only method of transport in a place with no streets. I&#x2019;d already decided I didn&#x2019;t miss them. I much preferred the sleek gondolas, with their singing boatmen, to the clatter of horse and carriage.<br>On both sides of us, glorious palazzi lined the water. Although built with precision, they had succumbed to centuries of shifting waters that left their facades with a pervasive asymmetry. This did not detract from their beauty. It only enhanced the feeling that one was gliding through something out of a dream.<br>As the elegant stone arches of the Rialto Bridge came into view, the gondolier steered us to the side of the canal and slowed to a stop in front of an imposing fourteenth-century palazzo, seat of the Barozzi family and Emma&#x2019;s marital home. I nearly lost my balance as I stepped out of the gondola onto the slippery marble pavement at the water entrance. My shaky legs told me I was nervous to meet my old rival.<br>A sinewy man opened a low wooden door and ushered us inside. &#x201c;Signor Hargreaves?&#x201d;<br>Colin nodded.<br>&#x201c;<i>Buongiorno</i>. Signora Barozzi is expecting you.&#x201d;<br>Although Emma&#x2019;s husband bore the title <i>conte</i> even before his father&#x2019;s death (it was given as a courtesy to all of a count&#x2019;s sons), no one in Italy used the term in direct address. Emma, who had made much out of becoming a contessa&#x2014;always using her title when signing letters and insisting that her parents&#x2019; servants address her as such when she visited England&#x2014;must be disappointed to be referred to as <i>signora.</i><br>We walked along a dark corridor and up a flight of marble stairs into a dim room, the <i>portego,</i> which ran the entire length of the house. At one end was the Barozzi family <i>restelliera,</i> a display of swords, scimitars, spears, shields, and banners hanging on the wall, below which stood two suits of fifteenth-century armor. At the other, large trefoil windows looked onto the canal, the light pouring through them providing the only illumination in the room. Neither of the large lanterns hanging above us was lit. Portraits of the Barozzi ancestors, in dire need of restoration and cleaning, lined the remaining walls, staring down as if to assert the family&#x2019;s noble roots. The fresco covering the tall ceiling was showing signs of decay&#x2014;the paint had started to peel&#x2014;and the bits of terrazzo floor that peeked beyond the edges of a threadbare Oriental carpet had lost their shine. Eloping might not have served Emma quite so well as she had hoped.<br>Some years back, at the insistence of her parents, Emma had accepted the proposal of the younger son of a minor English nobleman. It had appeared, after several unsuccessful seasons, to be her only hope for marriage. She had resisted the gentleman&#x2019;s affection for months, and we&#x2019;d all believed she&#x2019;d done so because she harbored higher aspirations. Who could have guessed that all along the dashing Conte Barozzi had been wooing her from afar and that they had plotted their elopement almost from the time they&#x2019;d met in a London ballroom?<br>After their secret marriage, Emma and her new husband fled to the conte&#x2019;s home in Venice, scandalizing the <i>ton,</i> everyone fashionable in society. Her family stood by her, and I&#x2019;d heard rumors that her father, ever devoted to his difficult daughter, continued to offer her financial support.

Her poems received critical praise and became the first step toward receiving the Pulitzer Award years later. An acclaimed poet of the Jazz Age, this liberated, often rebellious, woman enchanted us with her beautiful sonnets and lyrics, even as she surprised us with her unconventional personal life. This vibrant volume includes the complete selection of poems from Millay's first three books. Each gem reflects a different facet of the author's versatility.<br><i>Renascence and Other Poems</i> was Millay's first collection of poetry, a literary sensation when it was published in 1912. Acclaimed by critics for its remarkable use of compelling language and imagery, it is a deeply personal work that reflects the poet's spiritual awakening, using the themes of death and resurrection. In contrast, the poetry in <i>A Few Figs from Thistles</i> represents a cynical stage, a time of rebellion, and a search for personal freedom, as depicted in her famous line, "My candle burns at both ends." Part beauty, part despair, the free verse and heartfelt sonnets of <i>Second April</i> are an expression of Millay's feelings about love and disillusionment. Eloquent, daring, and sometimes bittersweet, these masterful lyrics exemplify the best work of a complex, passionate, and gifted poet. Includes a selection from the Common Core State Standards Initiative: "Afternoon on a Hill."</p><p>Edna St. Vincent Millay found her voice in a national poetry contest at the age of 20. In 1912, she won a prize for <i>Renascence</i>, just the first of many poems to win critical acclaim. The most famous poet of the Jazz Age, her passionate lyrics center on themes of spiritual awakening, love and personal freedom. In 1923, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for her fourth volume of poems, <i>The Harp Weaver</i>. <p></p></p><h2>Clues in the Shadows: A Molly Mystery (American Girl Mysteries)</h2><p>Molly still does her her patriotic duty to help America win World War Two, but in the spring of 1945 she's weary and troubled. Dad is home safe . . . but he seems different now. Her favorite Red Cross leader abruptly quits. Her archrival, Ronnie Vanko, is driving her crazy. And now someone is sneaking into the backyard shed and messing with the scrap she's collecting for the latest wartime drive. Who is the intruder: Ronnie, her own brother Ricky--or a prowler she spied in the night?<br><br>This book includes a richly illustrated "Peak Into The Past" essay.</p><p>This book was special to write because I was able to talk to people who'd lived through World War II. I heard stories from my parents, and from some of my husband's relatives, and from others who'd served in the military or kept things going on the homefront. It was also moving to read about all the things children did to help the war effort. I hope in some small way that <i>Clues in the Shadows</i> pays tribute to everyone who did the best they could in such difficult times.Grade 3-5&#x2013;In <i>Shadows</i>, Molly continues to do her patriotic duty by collecting scrap paper and costume jewelry and visiting the local veterans' hospital with the Junior Red Cross, but she and others around her are growing weary of the war. Her father has returned uninjured but he isn't his old, cheerful self; her favorite JRC leader mysteriously quits; and someone is interfering with Molly's collections for the paper drive. Multiple red herrings interspersed throughout the story keep readers guessing until the somewhat tame denouement, and the Looking Back section fills in some details on life during the end of World War II. In <i>Loon</i>, Samantha and her adopted sister visit their Grandmary's summer house. Samantha loves Piney Point and can't wait to show Nellie around. Shortly after her arrival, she is dismayed to learn that her grandmother is considering selling the property after experiencing numerous maintenance problems with mysterious origins. Suspicious fires, sabotaged canoes, and other dangers give this mystery more drama and urgency than others in the series, but readers not already familiar with Samantha will have difficulty placing the setting and time period based on the book's details. The Looking Back section helps to clarify some details about the attempts in the 1900s to develop this land in the Adirondacks.<i>&#x2013;Natasha Forrester, Multnomah County Library, Portland, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The soldiers in their beds propped themselves up. The boy went to the floor for a squatting dance. We all stood silently watching. The boy grinned. Some soldiers began clapping in rhythm but, just as the dance was about to end, the boy almost fell. His hand slapped the floor and broke the impact.

After years of serious thought, workshops, and practical applications, John Gray has created a brilliantly original and effective system that he calls positive parenting, for children of all ages, from birth though the teenage years. Completing the notion that Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, he adds. . .and Children Are from Heaven.</p><p>John Gray has discovered that children today do not need to be motivated by fear of punishment. Instead, they can easily be motivated by reward and the natural, healthy desire to please their parents.</p><p><em>Children Are from Heaven</em> covers the different skills of positive parenting to help improve communication, increase cooperation, and motivate your children. Central to this new approach to parenting are the five positive messages your children need to learn again and again:</p><p></p><ul><li>It's okay to be different <p></p><p></p></li><li>It's okay to make mistakes <p></p><p></p></li><li>It's okay to express negative emotions <p></p><p></p></li><li>It's okay to want more <p></p><p></p></li><li>It's okay to say no, but remember mom and dad are the bosses</li></ul><p></p><p>When these messages are put into practice -- and John Gray shows you how -- your children will develop the necessary skills for successful living: forgiveness of others and themselves, sharing, delayed gratification, self-esteem, patience, persistence respect for others and themselves, cooperation compassion, confidence, and the ability to be happy. With this new approach, you will be allowing your children to develop fully during each stage of their growth.</p><p>John Gray's reassuring message is that children are from heaven and they already have within themselves what they need to grow. Your job as a parent is to support that process. By applying the five messages and different skills of positive parenting, your children will receive what they need to become more cooperative, confident, and compassionate.</p></p><p>Psychologist John Gray (he of <i>Men Are from Mars...</i> fame) cites a need to shift from "fear-based parenting" (a punitive and oppressive approach to child rearing) to "love-based parenting" (which accepts children's desires and negative emotions while still setting reasonable limits). With child and teen violence increasing, rampant low self-esteem, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and attention deficit disorder, he says, "the Western free world is experiencing a crisis in parenting. Almost all parents today are questioning both the old and the new ways of parenting. Nothing seems to be working." <p> He suggests "Five Messages of Positive Parenting" that will facilitate such a shift: </p><ol> <li>It's okay to be different. </li><li>It's okay to make mistakes. </li><li>It's okay to express negative emotions. </li><li>It's okay to want more. </li><li>It's okay to say no, but remember mom and dad are the bosses. </li></ol><p> Although his parenting philosophy is not necessarily revolutionary (think "positive discipline"), Gray manages to keep this parenting primer contemporary by weaving in specific challenges of new-millennium families--such as our tendency to be consumer-driven and overscheduled. "When parents learn what their children really need, they are less motivated to create money to acquire things and more motivated to create time to enjoy their family," Gray writes. "The greatest wealth for a parent today is time." <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>John Gray, Ph.D., is one of the world&#x2019;s leading relationship experts, and an authority on improving communication styles for couples, companies, and communities.

Prior to becoming a writer, he worked as an engineer in a power plant in Yangquan. Translator KEN LIU&#39;s short story &#34;The Paper Menagerie&#34; was the first work of fiction ever to sweep the Nebula, Hugo, and World Fantasy Awards.&#39;Even what doesn&#39;t happen is epic&#39; London Review of Books. &#39;A book that you must have read, whether you are a Science Fiction fan or not. Cixin Liu tackles so many different topics from action, thriller and a strong emotional backdrop ... I cannot imagine what effort it must have cost to translate such an epic story to English but it paid off really well. A great performance&#39; The Book Plank. &#39;A really fascinating book and I&#39;m delighted that there are two more to come in the series ... I&#39;d recommend to readers who want to enjoy the science as much as the story&#39; SFcrowsnest. &#39;A book rich in ideas, puzzles and theories but each of them is explained in a way that isn&#39;t only accessible but is also absolutely engrossing ... The ideas are vast but they are beautifully expressed and, for this, credit must also go to Ken Liu who has done a fantastic job of translating this masterpiece. I loved where The Three Body-Problem took me - it is tense, wondrous and fascinating and I am so ready to read its successor, The Dark Forest, the next in this exciting, original and gobsmacking trilogy&#39; For Winter Nights. &#39;This book lives and dies by the quality of its ideas. Fortunately, the many, many different questions posed are fascinating and imaginative and I barreled through this novel right up to its gripping conclusion&#39; Bending Over Bookwards. &#39;A celebration of science as saviour&#39; The Hindu. SF iBook of the Year - Apple UK. &#39;A breakthrough book ... a unique blend of scientific and philosophical speculation, politics and history, conspiracy theory and cosmology, where kings and emperors from both western and Chinese history mingle in a dreamlike game world, while cops and physicists deal with global conspiracies, murders, and alien invasions in the real world&#39; George R.R. Martin. &#39;[The Three-Body Problem and The Dark Forest are] the works of fiction I am most enthusiastic about&#39; Bloomberg. &#39;For a book that makes you think, and holds true to some of the traditional values of SF, this one can&#39;t be beat&#39; SFF World Magazine. &#39;The writing is superb ... The ideas are astounding, real eye-openers that expand the mind and really get the old grey matter going ... A stand-out, award-worthy novel and one that deserves a place amongst the science fiction classics&#39; SF Book Reviews. &#39;Hard science fiction at its finest, and fans will appreciate the superb attention to detail that drives this constantly evolving and impressive series&#39; SciFiNow Magazine. &#39;China has a lively SF scene inaccessible to western audiences until recently, so it&#39;s a great pleasure to read this book by Cixin Liu - the country&#39;s most popular SF writer - in English. Handled expertly on the terms of the genre, it is seeing this tale played out through a different cultural lens that makes the book fascinating. The translation is exemplary. The book is top-flight SF; smart, informative and engaging&#39; SFX. &#39;It&#39;s a stunning, high-concept, rollercoaster of a novel which offers an intriguing Eastern perspective ... this is a trilogy which, like Asimov&#39;s Foundation epic, looks set to quickly become an essential science fiction classic&#39; Starburst Magazine (rating: 9/10). &#39;Liu Cixin&#39;s impressive The Three Body Problem won the 2015 Hugo award for best novel, the first time a Chinese writer has taken that prize&#39; Guardian (2015 Books of the Year). &#39;The best kind of science fiction&#39; Kim Stanley Robinson. &#39;A milestone in Chinese science fiction&#39; New York Times. &#39;A marvellous melange of awe-inspiring scientific concepts, clever plotting and quirky yet plausible characters, all conveyed in in a plain style capable of signalling hidden depths&#39; The Times. &#39;Wildly imaginative, really interesting ...

We can&#x2019;t stop constantly checking it on our computer screens, but what is this doing to our minds? We are never really taught how to make sense of the torrent of news we face every day, writes Alain de Botton (author of the best-selling The Architecture of Happiness), but this has a huge impact on our sense of what matters and of how we should lead our lives. In his dazzling new book, de Botton takes twenty-five archetypal news stories&#x2014;including an airplane crash, a murder, a celebrity interview and a political scandal&#x2014;and submits them to unusually intense analysis with a view to helping us navigate our news-soaked age. He raises such questions as Why are disaster stories often so uplifting? What makes the love lives of celebrities so interesting? Why do we enjoy watching politicians being brought down? Why are upheavals in far-off lands often so boring? In The News: A User&#x2019;s Manual, de Botton has written the ultimate guide for our frenzied era, certain</p><p><p><b>Alain de Botton</b> is the author of nonfiction works on subjects ranging from love and travel to architecture and philosophy. His best-selling books include <i>How Proust Can Change Your Life, The Art of Travel</i> and <i>The Architecture of Happiness</i>. He lives in London, where he founded The School of Life (www.theschooloflife.com) and Living Architecture (www.living-architecture.co.uk).</p><p><b><i>Preface</i></b><br><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>1.<br>&nbsp;<br>IT DOESN&#x2019;T COME with any instructions, because it&#x2019;s meant to be the most normal, easy, obvious and unremarkable activity in the world, like breathing or blinking. <br>&nbsp;<br>After an interval, usually no longer than a night (and often far less; if we&#x2019;re feeling particularly restless, we might only manage ten or fifteen minutes), we interrupt whatever we are doing in order to <i>check the news</i>. We put our lives on hold in the expectation of receiving yet another dose of critical information about all the most significant achievements, catastrophes, crimes, epidemics and romantic complications to have befallen mankind anywhere around the planet since we last had a look.<br>&nbsp;<br>What follows is an exercise in trying to make this ubiquitous and familiar habit seem a lot weirder and rather more hazardous than it does at present.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>2.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE NEWS IS committed to laying before us whatever is supposed to be most unusual and important in the world: a snowfall in the tropics; a love child for the president; a set of conjoined twins. Yet for all its determined pursuit of the anomalous, the one thing the news skilfully avoids training its eye on is itself, and the predominant position it has achieved in our lives. &#x2018;Half of Humanity Daily Spellbound by the News&#x2019; is a headline we are never likely to see from organizations otherwise devoted to the remarkable and the note-worthy, the corrupt and the shocking.<br>&nbsp;<br>Societies become modern, the philosopher Hegel suggested, when news replaces religion as our central source of guidance and our touchstone of authority. In the developed economies, the news now occupies a position of power at least equal to that formerly enjoyed by the faiths. Dispatches track the canonical hours with uncanny precision: matins have been transubstantiated into the breakfast bulletin, vespers into the evening report. But the news doesn&#x2019;t just follow a quasi-religious timetable. It also demands that we approach it with some of the same deferential expectations we would once have harboured of the faiths. Here, too, we hope to receive revelations, learn who is good and bad, fathom suffering and understand the unfolding logic of existence. And here too, if we refuse to take part in the rituals, there could be imputations of heresy. <br>&nbsp;<br>The news knows how to render its own mechanics almost invisible and therefore hard to question. It speaks to us in a natural unaccented voice, without reference to its own assumption-laden perspective. It fails to disclose that it does not merely <i>report</i> on the world, but is instead constantly at work crafting a new planet in our minds in line with its own often highly distinctive priorities.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>3.<br>&nbsp;<br>FROM AN EARLY age, we are educated to appreciate the power of images and words. We are led to museums and solemnly informed that certain pictures by long-dead artists could transform our perspectives. We are introduced to poems and stories that might change our lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet, oddly, people seldom attempt to educate us about the words and images proffered to us every hour by the news. It is deemed more important for us to know how to make sense of the plot of <i>Othello</i> than how to decode the front page of the <i>New York Post</i>. We are more likely to hear about the significance of Matisse&#x2019;s use of colour than to be taken through the effects of the celebrity photo section of the<i> Daily Mail</i>. We aren&#x2019;t encouraged to consider what might happen to our outlooks after immersion in<i> Bild</i> or <i>OK !</i> magazine, the <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</i> or the <i>Hokkaido Shimbun,</i> the <i>Tehran Times</i> or the <i>Sun.</i> We are never systematically inducted into the extraordinary capacity of news outlets to influence our sense of reality and to mould the state of what we might as well&#x2014;with no supernatural associations&#x2014;call our souls.<br>&nbsp;<br>For all their talk of education, modern societies neglect to examine by far the most influential means by which their populations are educated. Whatever happens in our classrooms, the more potent and ongoing kind of education takes place on the airwaves and on our screens. Cocooned in classrooms for only our first eighteen years or so, we effectively spend the rest of our lives under the tutelage of news entities which wield infinitely greater influence over us than any academic institution can. Once our formal education has finished, the news is the teacher. It is the single most significant force setting the tone of public life and shaping our impressions of the community beyond our own walls. It is the prime creator of political and social reality. As revolutionaries well know, if you want to change the mentality of a country, you don&#x2019;t head to the art gallery, the department of education or the homes of famous novelists; you drive the tanks straight to the nerve centre of the body politic, the news HQ.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>4.<br>&nbsp;<br>WHY DO WE, the audience, keep checking the news? Dread has a lot to do with it. After even a short period of being cut off from news, our apprehensions have a habit of accumulating. We know how much is liable to go wrong and how fast: an A380 may rupture its fuel line and cartwheel into the bay in flames, a virus from an African bat may leap the species barrier and infiltrate the air vents of a crowded Japanese commuter train, investors may precipitate a run on the currency and yet another deceptively ordinary father may call a violent end to the lives of his two beautiful young children.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the immediate vicinity, there might well be stability and peace. In the garden, a breeze may be swaying the branches of the plum tree and dust may slowly be gathering on the bookshelves in the living room. But we are aware that such serenity does not do justice to the chaotic and violent fundamentals of existence and hence, after a time, it has a habit of growing worrisome in its own way. Our background awareness of the possibility of catastrophe explains the small pulse of fear we may register when we angle our phones in the direction of the nearest mast and wait for the headlines to appear. It is a version of the apprehension that our distant ancestors must have felt in the chill moments before dawn, as they wondered whether the sun would ever find its way back into the firmament.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet there is a particular kind of pleasure at stake here too. The news, however dire it may be and perhaps especially when it is at its worst, can come as a relief from the claustrophobic burden of living with ourselves, of forever trying to do justice to our own potential and of struggling to persuade a few people in our limited orbit to take our ideas and needs seriously. To consult the news is to raise a seashell to our ears and to be overpowered by the roar of humanity. It can be an escape from our preoccupations to locate issues that are so much graver and more compelling than those we have been uniquely allotted, and to allow these larger concerns to drown out our own self-focused apprehensions and doubts. A famine, a flooded town, a serial killer on the loose, the resignation of a government, an economist&#x2019;s prediction of breadlines by next year; such outer turmoil is precisely what we might need in order to usher in a sense of inner calm.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today the news informs us of a man who fell asleep at the wheel of his car after staying up late into the night committing adultery on the Internet&nbsp;&#x2013; and drove off an overpass, killing a family of five in a caravan below. Another item speaks of a university student, beautiful and promising, who went missing after a party and was found in pieces in the trunk of a minicab five days later. A third rehearses the particulars of an affair between a tennis coach and her thirteen-year-old pupil. These occurrences, so obviously demented, invite us to feel sane and blessed by comparison. We can turn away from them and experience a new sense of relief at our predictable routines, at how tightly bound we have kept our more unusual desires and at our restraint in never yet having poisoned a colleague or entombed a relation under the patio.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>5.<br>&nbsp;<br>WHAT DOES ALL this news do to us over time? What remains of the months, even years we spend with it in aggregate? Whither those many excitements and fears: about the missing child, the budget shortfall and the unfaithful general? To what increase in wisdom did all these news stories contribute, beyond leaving behind a vague and unsurprising sediment of conclusions, for example, that China is rising, that central Africa is corrupt and that education must be reformed?<br>&nbsp;<br>It is a sign of our mental generosity that we don&#x2019;t generally insist on such questions. We imagine that there would be something wrong in simply switching off. It is hard to give up on the habit first established in our earliest years, as we sat cross-legged during school assembly, of listening politely to figures of authority while they tell us about things they proclaim to be essential.<br>&nbsp;<br>To ask why the news matters is not to presume that it doesn&#x2019;t, but to suggest the rewards of approaching our intake more self-consciously. This book is a record, a phenomenology, of a set of encounters with the news. It is framed around fragments of news culled from a variety of sources that have been subjected to analysis deliberately more elaborate than its creators intended, based on an assumption that these fragments might be no less worthy of study than lines of poetry or philosophy. <br>&nbsp;<br>The definition of news has deliberately been left vague. Though there are obvious differences between news organizations, there are also enough similarities for it to seem possible to speak of a generic category that blurs into one the traditional fiefdoms of news&#x2014;radio, TV, online and print&#x2014;and the contrasting ideologies of right and left, high- and lowbrow.<br>&nbsp;<br>This project has a utopian dimension to it. It not only asks what news currently is; it also tries to imagine what it could one day be. To dream of an ideal news organization shouldn&#x2019;t suggest an indifference to the current economic and social realities of the media; rather it stems from a desire to break out of a range of pessimistic assumptions to which we may have become too easily resigned. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>6.<br>&nbsp;<br>MODERN SOCIETIES ARE still at the dawn of understanding what kind of news they need in order to flourish. For most of history, news was so hard to gather and expensive to deliver, its hold on our inner lives was inevitably kept in check. Now there is almost nowhere on the planet we are able to go to escape from it. It is there waiting for us in the early hours when we wake up from a disturbed sleep; it follows us on board planes making their way between continents; it is waiting to hijack our attention during the children&#x2019;s bedtime.<br>&nbsp;<br>The hum and rush of the news have seeped into our deepest selves. What an achievement a moment of calm now is, what a minor miracle the ability to fall asleep or to talk undistracted with a friend&#x2014;and what monastic discipline would be required to make us turn away from the maelstrom of news and listen for a day to nothing but the rain and our own thoughts. <br>&nbsp;<br>We may need some help with what the news is doing to us: with the envy and the terror, with the excitement and the frustration; with all that we&#x2019;ve been told and yet occasionally suspect we may be better off never having learned.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hence a little manual that briefly tries to complicate a habit that, at present, has come to seem a bit too normal and harmless for our own good.</p></p><h2>COURSE IN MIRACLES: Sparkly Edition</h2><p>&#34;It is the Word of God, to be kept holy forever...&#34; &#34;This time there will be no failure, no loss of truth, no misunderstanding and no misrepresentation I will direct its growth as it reaches from the paper on which it was written into the hearts for which it was intended.&#34; (Special Message 12/31/75) As preface to this edition of A Course In Miracles, we acknowledge our realization of the truth of the words spoken to us through Helen Schucman as those of Jesus,&#34;the Way, the Truth and the Life.&#34; To you and all our brothers, we offer this edition of his A Course In Miracles. The task of editing, deciding which material would be excluded from the original dictation and that to be included in the published version, was entrusted to William Thetford.The edit of the Text used herein is Bill&#39;s, as he was directed by Jesus. The Workbook and Manual are as close to the un-edited generation of &#34;scribed&#34; dictation from Jesus to Helen as is available to us at this time. Similarly, the CAPITALIZATION and hyphenation of some of the words, along with the use of parenthesis and punctuation, remain consistent with the style of the &#34;scribes&#34; used in the source material. We recognize and honor the original intent of our Savior Jesus to be known as author with Helen as a &#34;just&#34; scribe whose name is not to be associated with authorship, but with the willingness to hear his voice and take notes. &#34;Do not attempt to break God&#39;s copyright, because His Authorship alone can copy right.&#34; (UR Text, 12/11/65) May this be to you, as it is NOW for us, the opening of your mind and heart to the Love of God. It is with His love and our gratitude that we offer thanks to all who have played their part in making this edition of A Course In Miracles available. And now our thanks to all.

I had heard of email, and knew that in some sense I would &#x201c;have&#x201d; it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be so fancy,&#x201d; said my mother&#x2019;s sister, who had married a computer scientist, &#x201c;sending your e&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mails.&#x201d; She emphasized the &#x201c;e&#x201d; and paused before &#x201c;mail.&#x201d;<br><br>That summer, I heard email mentioned with increasing frequency. &#x201c;Things are changing so fast,&#x201d; my father said. &#x201c;Today at work I surfed the World Wide Web. One second, I was in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. One second later, I was in An&#x131;tkabir.&#x201d; An&#x131;tkabir, Atat�rk&#x2019;s mausoleum, was located in Ankara. I had no idea what my father was talking about, but I knew there was no meaningful sense in which he had been &#x201c;in&#x201d; Ankara that day, so I didn&#x2019;t really pay attention.<br><br>On the first day of college, I stood in line behind a folding table and eventually received an email address and temporary password. The &#x201c;address&#x201d; had my last name in it&#x2014;Karada&#x11f;, but all lowercase, and without the Turkish <i>&#x11f;</i>, which was silent. From an early age I had understood that a silent <i>g</i> was funny. &#x201c;The <i>g</i> is silent,&#x201d; I would say in a weary voice, and it was always hilarious. I didn&#x2019;t understand how the email address was an address, or what it was short for. &#x201c;What do we do with this, hang ourselves?&#x201d; I asked, holding up the Ethernet cable.<br><br>&#x201c;You plug it into the wall,&#x201d; said the girl behind the table.&nbsp;<br><br>Insofar as I&#x2019;d had any idea about it at all, I had imagined that email would resemble faxing, and would involve a printer. But there was no printer. There was another world. You could access it from certain computers, which were scattered throughout the ordinary landscape, and looked no different from regular computers. Always there, unchanged, in a configuration nobody else could see, was a glowing list of messages from all the people you knew, and from people you didn&#x2019;t know, all in the same letters, like the universal handwriting of thought or of the world. Some messages were formally epistolary, with &#x201c;Dear&#x201d; and &#x201c;Sincerely&#x201d;; others telegraphic, all in lowercase with missing punctuation, like they were being beamed straight from people&#x2019;s brains. And each message contained the one that had come before, so your own words came back to you&#x2014;all the words you threw out, they came back. It was like the story of your relations with others, the story of the intersection of your life with other lives, was constantly being recorded and updated, and you could check it at any time.<br><br>&nbsp;You had to wait in a lot of lines and collect a lot of printed materials, mostly instructions: how to respond to sexual harassment, report an eating disorder, register for student loans. They showed you a video about a recent college graduate who broke his leg and defaulted on his student loans, proving that the budget he drew up was no good: a good budget makes provisions for debilitating injury. The bank was a real bonanza, as far as lines and printed materials were concerned. They gave you a free dictionary. The dictionary didn&#x2019;t include &#x201c;ratatouille&#x201d; or &#x201c;Tasmanian devil.&#x201d;<br><br>On the staircase approaching my room, I could hear tuneless singing and the slap of plastic slippers. My new roommate, Hannah, was standing on a chair, taping a sign that read Hannah Park&#x2019;s Desk over her desk, chanting monotonously along with Blues Traveler on her Discman. When I came in, she turned in a pantomime of �surprise, pitching to and fro, then jumped noisily to the floor and took off her headphones.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you considered mime as a career?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Mime?</i> No, my dear, I&#x2019;m afraid my parents sent me to Harvard to become a surgeon, not a mime.&#x201d; She blew her nose loudly. &#x201c;Hey&#x2014;<i>my </i>bank didn&#x2019;t give me a dictionary!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t have &#x2018;Tasmanian devil,&#x2019; &#x201d; I said.<br><br>She took the dictionary from my hands, rifling the pages. &#x201c;It has plenty of words.&#x201d;<br><br>I told her she could have it. She put it on the shelf next to the dictionary she had gotten in high school, for being the valedictorian. &#x201c;They look good together,&#x201d; she said. I asked if her other dictionary had &#x201c;Tasmanian devil.&#x201d; It didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t the Tasmanian devil a cartoon character?&#x201d; she asked, looking suspicious. I showed her the page in my other dictionary that had not just &#x201c;Tasmanian devil,&#x201d; but also &#x201c;Tasmanian wolf,&#x201d; with a picture of the wolf glancing, a bit sadly, over its left shoulder.<br><br>Hannah stood very close to me and stared at the page. Then she looked right and left and whispered hotly in my ear, &#x201c;That music has been playing all day long.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What music?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shhh&#x2014;stand absolutely still.&#x201d;<br><br>We stood absolutely still. Faint romantic strings drifted from under the door of our other roommate, Angela.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the sound track for <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>,&#x201d; whispered Hannah. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been playing it all morning, since I got up. She&#x2019;s just been sitting in there with the door shut, playing the tape over and over again. I knocked and asked her to turn it down but you can still hear it. I had to listen to my Discman to drown her out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that loud,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s just weird that she sits<i> </i>there like that.&#x201d;<br><br>Angela had gotten to our three-person, two-bedroom suite at seven the previous morning and taken the single bedroom, leaving Hannah and me to share the one with bunk beds. When I got there in the evening, I found Hannah storming around in a fury, moving furniture, sneezing, and shouting about Angela. &#x201c;I never even saw her!&#x201d; Hannah yelled from under her desk. She suddenly succeeded in detaching two things she had been pulling at, and banged her head. &#x201c;OWW!&#x201d; she yelled. She crawled out and pointed wrathfully at Angela&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;These books? They&#x2019;re fake!&#x201d; She seized what looked like a stack of four leather-bound volumes, one with <i>The Holy Bible</i> printed on the spine, shook it under my nose, and slammed it down again. It was a wooden box. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s even in there?&#x201d; She knocked on the Bible. &#x201c;Her last testament?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hannah, please be gentle with other people&#x2019;s property,&#x201d; said a soft voice, and I noticed two small Koreans, evidently Hannah&#x2019;s parents, sitting in the window seat.<br><br>Angela came in. She had a sweet expression and was black, and was wearing a Harvard windbreaker and a Harvard backpack. Hannah immediately confronted her about the single room.<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm, yeah,&#x201d; Angela said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just I got here really early and I had so many suitcases.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I kind of noticed the suitcases,&#x201d; said Hannah. She flung open the door to Angela&#x2019;s room. A yellowed cloth and a garland of cloth roses had been draped over the one tiny window, and in the murk stood four or five human-sized suitcases.<br><br>I said maybe we could each have the single room for a third of the year, with Angela going first. Angela&#x2019;s mother came in, dragging another suitcase. She stood in the doorway to Angela&#x2019;s room. Her body filled the entire doorway. &#x201c;It is what it is,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Hannah&#x2019;s father stood up and took out a camera. &#x201c;First college roommates! That&#x2019;s an important relationship!&#x201d; he said. He took several pictures of Hannah and me but none of Angela.<br><br>Hannah bought a refrigerator for the common room. She said I could use it if I bought something for the room, too, like a poster. I asked what kind of poster she had in mind.<br><br>&#x201c;Psychedelic,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know what a psychedelic poster was, so she showed me her psychedelic notebook. It had a fluorescent tie-dyed spiral, with purple lizards walking around the spiral and disappearing into the center.<br><br>&#x201c;What if they don&#x2019;t have that?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Then a photograph of Albert Einstein,&#x201d; she said decisively, as if it were the obvious next choice.<br><br>&#x201c;Albert Einstein?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, one of those black-and-white pictures. You know: Einstein.&#x201d;<br><br>The campus bookstore turned out to have a huge selection of Albert Einstein posters. There was Einstein at a blackboard, Einstein in a car, Einstein sticking out his tongue, Einstein smoking a pipe. I didn&#x2019;t totally understand why we had to have an image of Einstein on the wall. But it was better than buying my own refrig�erator.<br><br>The poster I got was no better or worse than the other Einstein posters in any way that I could see, but Hannah seemed to dislike it. &#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;ll look good there.&#x201d; She pointed to the space over my bookshelf.<br><br>&#x201c;But then <i>you</i> can&#x2019;t see it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay. It goes best there.&#x201d;<br><br>From that day on, everyone who happened by our room&#x2014;�neighbors wanting to borrow stuff, residential computer staff, student council candidates, all kinds of people to whom my small enthusiasms should have been a source of little or no concern&#x2014;went out of their way to&nbsp;disabuse me of my great admiration for Albert Einstein. Einstein had&nbsp;invented the atomic bomb, abused dogs, neglected his children. &#x201c;There were many greater geniuses than Einstein,&#x201d; said a guy from down the hall, who had stopped by to borrow<i> </i>my copy of Dostoevsky&#x2019;s <i>The Double</i>. &#x201c;Alfred Nobel hated mathematics and didn&#x2019;t give the Nobel Prize to any mathematicians. There were many who were more deserving.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; I handed him the book. &#x201c;Well, see you around.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; he said, glaring at the poster. &#x201c;This is the man who beats his wife, forces her to solve his mathematical problems, to do the dirty work, and he denies her credit. And you put his picture on your wall.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Listen, leave me out of this,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not really my poster. It&#x2019;s a complicated situation.&#x201d;<br><br>He wasn&#x2019;t listening. &#x201c;Einstein in this country is synonymous with genius, while many greater geniuses aren&#x2019;t famous at all. Why is this? I am asking you.&#x201d;<br><br>I sighed. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s because he&#x2019;s really the best, and even jealous mudslingers can&#x2019;t hide his star quality,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Nietzsche would say that such a great genius is <i>entitled </i>to beat his wife.&#x201d;<br><br>That shut him up. After he left, I thought about taking down the poster. I wanted to be a courageous person, uncowed by other people&#x2019;s dumb opinions. But what was the dumb opinion: thinking Einstein was so great, or thinking he was the worst? In the end, I left the poster up.<br><br>Hannah snored. Everything in the room that wasn&#x2019;t a solid block of wood&#x2014;the windowpanes, the bed girders, the mattress springs, my rib cage&#x2014;vibrated in sympathy. It did no good to wake her up or roll her over. She just started again a minute later. If she was asleep, I was by definition awake, and vice versa.<br><br>I convinced Hannah that she had obstructive sleep apnea, which was depriving her brain cells of oxygen and compromising her chances of getting into a top-ten medical school. She went to the campus health center and came back with a box of adhesive strips that were supposed to prevent snoring by sticking to your nose. A photograph on the box showed a man and a woman gazing into the distance, wearing matching plastic nose strips, a breeze ruffling the woman&#x2019;s hair.<br><br>Hannah pulled her nose up from the side, and I smoothed the strip in place with my thumbs. Her face felt so small and doll-like that I felt a wave of tenderness toward her. Then she started yelling about something, and the feeling passed. The nose strips actually worked, but they gave Hannah sinus headaches, so she stopped using them.<br><br>In the long days that stretched between even longer nights, I stumbled from room to room taking placement tests. You had to sit in a basement writing essays about whether it was better to be a Renaissance person or a specialist. There was a quantitative reasoning test full of melancholy word problems&#x2014;&#x201c;The graph models the hypothetical mass in grams of a broiler chicken up to eighty weeks of age&#x201d;&#x2014;and every evening was some big meeting where you sat on the floor and learned that you were now a little fish in a big sea, and were urged to view this circumstance as an exhilarating challenge rather than a source of anxiety. I tried not to give too much weight to the thing about the fish, but after a while it started to get me down anyway. It was hard to feel cheerful when someone kept telling you you were a little fish in a big sea.<br><br>My academic adviser, Carol, had a British accent and worked at the Office of Information Technologies. Twenty years ago, in the 1970s, she had received a master&#x2019;s degree from Harvard in Old Norse. I knew that the Office of Information Technologies was where you mailed your telephone bill each month. Other than that, its sphere of activity was mysterious. How was Old Norse involved? On the subject of her work, Carol said only, &#x201c;I wear many hats.&#x201d;<br><br>Hannah and I both caught a terrible cold. We took turns buying cold medicine and knocked it back like shots from the little plastic&nbsp;cup.<br><br>When it came time to choose classes, everyone said it was of utmost importance to apply to freshman seminars, because otherwise it could be years before you had a chance to work with senior faculty. I applied to three literature seminars and got called in for one interview. I reported to the top floor of a cold white building, where I shivered for twenty minutes on a leather sofa under a skylight wondering if I&nbsp;was in the right place. There were some strange newspapers on the coffee table. That was the first time I saw the <i>Times Literary �Supplement</i>. I couldn&#x2019;t understand anything in the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>.<br><br>A door opened and the professor called me in. He extended his hand&#x2014;an enormous hand on an incredibly skinny, pale wrist, further dwarfed by a gigantic overcoat.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I should shake your hand,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I have this cold.&#x201d; Then I had a violent fit of sneezing. The professor looked startled, but recovered quickly. &#x201c;Gesundheit,&#x201d; he said urbanely. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry you aren&#x2019;t feeling well. These first days of college can be rough on the immune system.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m learning,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s all about,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Learning! Ha, ha.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ha, ha,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s get down to business. From your application, you seem to be very creative. I enjoyed your creative application essay. My only concern is that you realize this seminar is an academic class, not a creative class.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said, nodding energetically and trying to determine whether any of the rectangles in my peripheral vision was a box of tissues. Unfortunately, they were all books. The professor was talking about the differences between creative and academic writing. I kept nodding. I was thinking about the structural equivalences between a tissue box and a book: both consisted of slips of white paper in a cardboard case; yet&#x2014;and this was ironic&#x2014;there was very little functional equivalence, especially if the book wasn&#x2019;t yours. These were the kinds of things I thought about all the time, even though they were neither pleasant nor useful.

The parents of five children, they live in Provo, Utah. Meet them on their Web site at www.allbetter.net.Based on Gary Lundberg's work in family and relationship counseling, this revised version of a self-published work wisely maintains the deliberately simple narrative voice of the original. The authors call for "validation," a powerful technique for improving one-on-one communication that involves careful, empathetic listening to another person's feelings without judging, criticizing or attempting to solve his or her problems. The authors demonstrate this technique's startling effectiveness in a variety of situations and provide readers with valuable coaching and specific responses, cautioning that authentic validation is grounded in respect and honesty, or else it might be seen as manipulation. The Lundbergs include many recognizable examples from their workshop practice and from their experience as parents of five. Some sample situations may be resolved a bit too easily for some tastes, but even the most jaded reader is bound to learn from the material, which holds special appeal for parents of young children. Anyone who has been confronted with a spouse or a child who had a bad day, a cranky customer, colleague or demanding relative stands to benefit from the Lundbergs' advice.

Johnston and the other guard don&#x2019;t laugh.</p><p>Dreyers whispers, lower now, under his breath, to me only. &#x201c;Pretty soon they&#x2019;ll pop the question.&#x201d;</p><p>I look at him.</p><p>&#x201c;For $64,000&#x2014;how long can you hold your breath?&#x2019; He gives me a little sideways wink. I can hear some giggling on the other side of Dreyers. Another cop, one of his buddies.</p><p>Bad taste, I think. But as I study the scene, he&#x2019;s right. Now this room with its cupola-like top, lit on the inside like some Macy&#x2019;s store window, does not resemble anything so much as one of the glittering, cheesy booths from a sixties TV quiz show.</p><p>A lone guard enters the room through a door on the other side of the chamber. Muffled cries, intonations of a desperate low moan are clearly audible as the door is closed.</p><p>Now each calculated procedure is a step closer to death for the man waiting on the other side of that door. In quick, measured movements the guard lowers two sets of green venetian blinds, covering windows on the other side of the chamber. These will mask the execution team as they open the valves and throw the lever to release the lethal gas.</p><p>Then I see them, the size of two softballs. Granules of sodium cyanide, like fine baking powder, a pound each, have been tied and molded into a round form. They are held in two pieces of cheesecloth and fastened to a device over the vat under each chair. These deadly chemical balls hang tenuously by wire from two curved metal arms. When the lever is thrown these arms will drop, the cyanide falling into the pots of sulfuric acid and water. For safety the two vats are now empty.</p><p>Sally Ryan&#x2019;s father is here, a decade older, grayer, the lines of his face more deeply etched than I remember. He stands apart from the rest of us, as if he&#x2019;s on a different mission, some ancient and sacred vendetta bred of human instinct. The memory of a defiled and murdered child is long.</p><p>I asked Ryan about the parents of the other girl, Linda Maldinado. &#x201c;Divorced,&#x201d; he said, as if this explained their absence. What he meant was, destroyed&#x2014;ravaged by a grieving they could not conclude while this thing remained open, incomplete. It&#x2019;s the first I&#x2019;ve seen of either family since the trial, when Ryan and the more aggressive Mrs. Maldinado hovered with me in hallways, demanding assurance that justice wouldn&#x2019;t be stillborn. Ryan eyes me now with a cynicism that is palpable, an abiding bitterness that the journey has taken this long.</p><p>My own presence here is as a favor to Sam Jennings, the DA now out of office with whom I prosecuted Danley. Jennings is sick, too ill to make this appointment, perhaps too close to death himself to stare it squarely in the eye.</p><p>Gale Haight is here. I nodded to him as we boarded the van. He didn&#x2019;t return the gesture. A normally affable man two years my senior in law school, Haight cannot bring himself to even a grudging greeting on this day. He carries a heavy burden, having defended Danley at trial.</p><p>There are a few cops here, represented because the law says they must be. The others, ten men and two women, I suspect are political favorites of the governor or the director of corrections, official guests for this grim task.</p><p>I stand next to Jim Dreyers, now retired from the sheriff&#x2019;s department. Dreyers had tracked Brian Danley to a girlfriend&#x2019;s apartment after the killings. Backed up by the SWAT team, he&#x2019;d made the arrest and led Danley, with hands cuffed behind his back, to a squad car. The suspect spat at cameras all the way there; a large green lugi caught in mid-flight centered the frame of one of the shots. It made the cover of <i>Newsweek,</i> a special crime edition.</p><p>Since the conviction, Danley&#x2019;s been handled by skilled appellate attorneys, people who&#x2019;ve delayed this date six times in seven years. Whenever cameras are made available now, Danley is the picture of polite reserve. A bleeding-heart piece in the bar association&#x2019;s house organ a year ago pictured him the circumspect image of justice denied. He is, if the story is to be believed, the pitiable victim of fetal-alcohol syndrome. An army of shrinks is now assembled to attest to this malady. It&#x2019;s the latest in an endless series of social ills raised to excuse his crime, or at a minimum to avoid its punishment. These news articles are well placed for maximum effect. They don&#x2019;t play in the magazines &#x201c;for inquiring minds.&#x201d; Instead Danley&#x2019;s lawyers shoot for a more lofty readership, fed into publications an appellate judge might read in an idle hour.</p><p>The chamber door, something from a vintage submarine, is open facing the other side.</p><p>Three people were already in the room when we arrived, an older woman and two clergymen. One of them comforts the woman, an arm around her shoulder. She, I assume, is family.</p><p>Confronting him daily through four months of trial seven years ago, I wonder whether Danley will show the same sand now. Then, he&#x2019;d been hard. Unremitting.</p><p>He was his own lawyer&#x2019;s worst nightmare. Through weeks of trial endless versions of a smug expression occupied his face. He smiled through half-a-day of horrors&#x2014;testimony by the medical examiner that caused one juror to lose her breakfast. Against the advice of his own attorney he took the stand, denying all association with the crime, this in utter contradiction to a sea of physical evidence that included his own fingerprints at the scene. Danley was at some loss to explain how they&#x2019;d become superimposed in the blood of his two victims.</p><p>After conviction, in the penalty phase, to an astonished jury which was only a little less dazed than his own lawyer, Danley admitted that he&#x2019;d done it. His version of throwing himself on the mercy of the jury, it seems, was a public survey of the crimes in mind-wrenching detail.</p><p>I remember the vivid photos of Sally Ryan and the Maldinado girl after they had been raped and sodomized. These shots were dominated by the grotesque rust hues of congealed blood&#x2014;their throats sliced with the precision of a scalpel. Danley used the razor-sharp hooked blade of a linoleum knife. &#x201c;A tool of the trade,&#x201d; he called it. This particular knife hadn&#x2019;t seen linoleum in years. He kept it for special occasions. It was once used to carve a deep letter &#x201c;A,&#x201d; to the bone, in his wife&#x2019;s right cheek. Danley, after a little too much to drink, found himself fantasizing about marital infidelities on the part of his common-law wife, a woman he hadn&#x2019;t seen in a year. Some bar-babbling luminary, it seems, had given him a more lurid than literal review of <i>The Scarlet Letter.</i> I steel myself with the thought that Brian Danley is a creature the world is well rid of.</p><p>I check my watch. It&#x2019;s now one minute past the appointed hour. There are noises on the other side of the chamber. The agonized wailing of a man, his words, except for one, unintelligible. The repetition of a single syllable grows louder: &#x201c;No-o-o-o...&#x201d;</p><p>Two stone-faced guards enter from the other side. Behind them, struggling feebly, Brian Trevor Danley is unrecognizable to me. Forty pounds lighter than at any time during the trial, he is a ghost. The swagger and bravado are gone. His knees are bent, feet dragging. He&#x2019;s carried under each arm by two guards, bulls who could snap him like a twig should he resist. Danley&#x2019;s hands are manacled in front. His eyes are wild, haunted, searching as if to devour every image left to them in the seconds that remain. He searches the faces beyond the glass without apparent recognition as his stockinged feet are dragged over the threshold into the chamber. As he&#x2019;s turned and pushed down into the chair, he sees her. His eyes light up.</p><p>&#x201c;Bampa. Bampa.&#x201d;</p><p>He&#x2019;s imploring the woman with the two clergymen. Her arms are extended, as if she could reach out and grab him.</p><p>I nudge Dreyers and motion with my head toward the woman.</p><p>&#x201c;His aunt. Bampa&#x2019;s the name he gave her as a kid.&#x201d; Dreyers shrugs his shoulders as if to say &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t blame me.&#x201d;</p><p>Danley&#x2019;s wearing a pressed blue work shirt, the kind made here by inmates, open at the neck, and prison denim pants. The fact that he&#x2019;s shoeless says reams about this journey. From the front of his shirt protrudes a small black tube. This is part of the stethoscope which will be connected to a device in the wall. From this a physician will determine the instant of death.</p><p>In quick, efficient motions, three of the officers strap him into the metal chair. Two-inch web straps, two around each arm, two around the chest and abdomen, hold him erect and still. The other guard straps his legs tightly to the chair. They are finished in less than a minute. Three of the guards leave. The last hooks up the stethoscope, then gives Danley a quick pat on the knee and says something to him. I can&#x2019;t hear the words, but I read his lips. &#x201c;When you hear the gas, breathe deeply.&#x201d;</p><p>Now Danley is terror-stricken, beyond comprehension, his head whipping wildly from side to side. His moan is constant, a low groan from the tiny room, a tortured mantra.</p><p>The last guard ducks backward out of the chamber, and the door is closed and sealed from the outside. The cries of agony inside are now muted. He turns his head and looks back at us. &#x201c;Somebody ...&#x201d; His words trail off and I can&#x2019;t make out the rest. But this is some form of plea. He&#x2019;s begging for someone to intervene.</p><p>At two minutes past the hour, the condemned is alone in the sealed chamber.</p><p>Suddenly his head slump...</p></p><h2>Peony</h2><p>Young Peony is sold into a rich Chinese household as a bondmaid -- an awkward role in which she is more a servant, but less a daughter.

The theft and burning of his body marked the end of Gram Parsons&#x2019; life and the beginning of the Gram Parsons legend.<br><br>As a singer and songwriter, Gram Parsons stood at the nexus of countless musical crossroads, and he sold his soul to the devil at every one. Parson hung out with glamorous women and the coolest friends. His intimates and collaborators on his journey included Keith Richards, William Burroughs, Marianne Faithfull, Peter Fonda, Roger McGuinn, Clarence White, and Emmylou Harris. Parsons had everything&#x2013;looks, charisma, money, style, the best drugs, the most heartbreaking voice&#x2013;and threw it all away with both hands. His ballad is one of gigantic talent colliding with epic self-destruction.<br><br>Parsons led the Byrds to create the seminal country rock masterpiece Sweetheart of the Rodeo. He formed the Flying Burrito Brothers, helped to guide the Rolling Stones beyond the blues in their appreciation of American roots music, and found his musical soul mate in Emmylou Harris.

The antecedents of Ingram Cecil Parsons, ne Ingram Cecil Connor III, were pure Faulkner, his upbringing a catalog of Southern dysfunction. The critical pathway of his ancestry brings together the moralistic complacency of small-town wealth and the hunger of the small-town hustler: two key routes to the American dream, played out in their most lurid Southern form. Out of generations of wanting sprang a man who never pursued anything because he was too busy fleeing from himself.<br><br>Gram came from money, vast amounts of it, and alcohol, in equally vast amounts. He had three parents--his father, Ingram Cecil "Coon Dog" Connor; his mother, Avis Snively; and his stepfather, Robert Parsons--and amid all their differences and conflicts, pedigree, money, alcohol, and self-destruction ran through their lives like the helix of their doomed Southern DNA.<br><br>Coon Dog Connor came out of his sky. He tilted the shark-painted mouth of his black Grumman P-40 Warhawk into a blinding shaft of glare and dropped straight down from the sun. When he thumbed the red button centered on his joystick, the wing-mounted .50-caliber machine guns made the whole plane shudder. The balsa-wood Zero in his crosshairs exploded into flinders. Dead Jap aviators floated like eiderdown through the soft warm air over the far southwestern Pacific. Turning his fighter back to the sun in search of new prey, Coon Dog Connor never saw them splash.<br><br>When he touched down on the clanking metal airstrip, his canopy was already shoved back. Coon Dog's mechanic ran alongside the plane in the crushing jungle heat, leaped onto the still-moving wing, and passed Coon Dog his celebratory bottle of Jack Daniel's . . . or maybe it was Rebel Yell or Maker's Mark or homemade jungle hooch; who knows?<br><br>Coon Dog Connor shot down numerous Japanese pilots over the Pacific Ocean in World War II, bombed and strafed even more of them when they were on the ground, and consumed vast quantities of whiskey, in the process becoming an Army Air Corps flying ace, a genuine war hero, and a certifiable alcoholic. After two years of aerial combat, Coon Dog sailed from New Guinea for Australia on a hospital ship. There he was treated for the malaria that eventually sent him stateside for good in 1944.<br><br>His specific flights, number of kills, and the date and route of his rotation back to the States vanished on July 12, 1973, when the Defense Department's World War II archives in East St. Louis, Illinois, went up in flames as all-consuming as those that broiled Coon Dog's airborne enemies. What we do know is where his unit served and in what battles they fought, and there's no question of Coon Dog's prowess, courage, or fightin' want-to.<br><br>Ingram Cecil Connor was bred to the military. He and his brother, Tom, attended their father's high school, Columbia Military Academy, in Columbia, Tennessee. Cecil's folks were native Tennesseans. His father was born in Mount Pleasant in 1887, his mother in Columbia in 1889, and both would outlive their son by more than a generation.<br><br>Cecil's dad came from a well-to-do farming family. His mom's father was a lawyer. Amid the rolling hills and small lakes of eastern Tennessee, that placed both families solidly in the haute bourgeoisie. Though the two families had been in the South--and well off--for more than a hundred years, and though they had illustrious ancestors who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War, surviving family members insist that none of the Connors ever owned slaves. On this they are adamant.<br><br>After graduating from Draughn's Business College in Nashville, Cecil's father settled in Columbia. He worked as a sales rep for two Nashville hardware companies, Gray &amp; Dudley and Keith-Simmons. He traveled for work and was seldom home during the week. He made an excellent living and provided a good life for his family.<br><br>Cecil, his younger sister, Pauline, and his brother, Tom, grew up on a dead-end street in a big formal house with an entrance hall, four bedrooms, and front and back porches. The front room held a piano and all three kids took lessons. Cecil's mother's side of the family supplied the musical genes. Cecil's maternal grandmother, Ella Dotson Kelly, played the organ at Columbia's First Methodist Church for thirty years. Grandma Kelly was always at the piano in the Connor parlor, playing but never singing. Cecil Connor never sang, either.<br><br>Pauline Wilkes, Cecil's sister, recalls three kinds of music in the household: hymns, classical, and big band. She remembers Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and especially "Moonlight Serenade." The children took classical lessons three times a week, but their relationship to music was lighthearted. In high school and college Cecil clowned around with an old ukulele. When brother Tom attended Vanderbilt University, he followed in his grandmother's footsteps and played organ in church. "We never listened to country music," Pauline Wilkes says.<br><br>Cecil, Pauline, and Tom were raised in the old-school, small-town Southern manner, a manner that lingered well into the sixties. "We answered a question with 'sir' and 'ma'am,'" says Pauline Wilkes. "We stood up when an adult entered the room; that was good manners. We never questioned anything our parents told us to do. If they told us to do something or not do something, that was all that was necessary. That was the way children were brought up in the South. My children were raised the same. Gram was raised that way too, until his father died."<br><br>Columbia prospered as a mill town. When Maury County, of which Columbia is the county seat, was found to be full of phosphate, Monsanto and other big chemical companies built plants. The county's economy was rock solid and thriving. Cecil's father was on the road five days a week, but his family enjoyed their leisure.<br><br>Cecil's dad had grown up on a gentleman's farm; he was bred to the woods and loved hunting and fishing. As soon as his sons were old enough, they were given .410 shotguns. The .410 is a small gauge with a light kick, light enough for a young boy to shoot. Cecil Connor loved guns; he was an avid hunter and an excellent shot. In Columbia he hunted dove and quail, wandering through the fields with the family dogs; when he was stationed in New Guinea he wrote home of wild boar hunts in the jungle.<br><br>Their father bought the boys an Indian canoe in which they plied the local Duck River, paddling and swimming. Cecil had a best friend, Van Shapard, whom he met at the age of five; they stayed best friends for life. Together they took the canoe to the local landmark, Big Rock, for overnight campouts. Big Rock was known as the place where only boys swam. No girls were allowed.<br><br>Pauline Wilkes recalls lazy summer evenings with the neighborhood adults gathered on the deep shaded porch after dinner, watching their children play Kick the Can and Capture the Flag. Kids and parents always gathered at the Connor house.<br><br>All of Cecil's people concur: For all the good it did him later, Cecil Connor, a beloved son in a loving family, lived a sheltered, privileged, stressless childhood and adolescence. Life came easily to Cecil, as it would to his son.<br><br>Cecil was a Boy Scout. And when he left the Scouts in his teenage years his passion turned to cars and airplanes. Cecil's folks drove regular old vehicles, but Cecil dreamed of a red convertible. His other dreams centered on flight. He and his pal Van Shapard were always talking about planes and how they would learn to fly. When Cecil (and Shapard) entered Columbia Military, his ambitions were all about the Air Corps. The school closed after World War II, but for the time it had a demanding curriculum.<br><br>As a young man Cecil's eyes seemed to slant a bit, so the first nickname he acquired at Columbia Military was "Chink." That was the name everyone in town, children and adults, called him. "Chink" was in the old Southern manner, too.<br><br>Pauline Wilkes remembers her brother as "an extremely popular boy. He was a good-looking boy all his life. My friends would come over just to be with him." Although Cecil dated often, he had no great love in high school. Already Cecil manifested the same quality of relaxed separateness that would mark his son.<br><br>Cecil grew to be manly, affable, charming, and socially at ease. At Columbia he became a student leader and the alpha of his social pack, pulling out his ever-present ukulele at parties and taking it on dates. In school he devoted himself to the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) to ensure that he would join the service as an officer, because it was officers who became pilots.<br><br>When Cecil graduated, he and Van Shapard set off for Alabama Polytechnic Institute in Auburn. Established in 1856 and made coed in 1892, the Polytechnic is today better known by the name it took in 1961: Auburn University. Van Shapard and Cecil studied aeronautical engineering and both were officers in the ROTC. Cecil's family says he graduated in 1939. Auburn University disagrees; he attended Alabama Polytechnic, but no record exists that he left with a degree.<br><br>In any event, when Cecil was done with college, his and Van Shapard's paths diverged. After joining the Army Air Corps together, Cecil stayed in the Army while Van Shapard opted for the Flying Tigers. Cecil would end up in the Pacific Theater; Van Shapard would fly "over the hump" from India to China over the Himalayas.<br><br>Cecil took his aviation training at Kelly Field in Texas. During training he drove around Kelly Field in the red convertible he'd always wanted. On May 11, 1940, he graduated flight school and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps. His proud mother pinned his flight wings to his chest.<br><br>Cecil remained at Kelly Field until March 1941, when he transferred to Wheeler Field near Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

In each chapter, he discusses a particular book and how it relates to concerns we all share. These books span centuries and genres&#x2014;from&nbsp;<i>Stuart Little</i>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>The Girl on the Train</i>, from&nbsp;<i>David Copperfield </i>to <i>Wonder</i>, from <i>Giovanni's Room </i>to<i> Rebecca</i>, and from&nbsp;<i>1984</i>&nbsp;to <i>Gifts from the Sea</i>. Throughout, Schwalbe tells stories from his life and focuses on the way certain books can help us honor those we've loved and lost, and also figure out how to live each day more fully.</p><p><b>WILL SCHWALBE</b>&nbsp;has worked in publishing; digital media, as the founder and CEO of Cookstr.com; and as a journalist, writing for various publications, including <i>The New York Times</i> and the <i>South China Morning Post</i>.

I call it the Reader&#x2019;s Nightmare.&nbsp;<br><br> I&#x2019;m in a busy airport, and they&#x2019;ve announced my flight. There is an epic walk to the gate, and I know I have only a few minutes before they will close the door to the jetway and my plane will leave without me. Suddenly, I realize that I don&#x2019;t have a book to read on the flight. Not one single book. I spin around, my eyes searching frantically for a bookstore. I see none. I run through the airport, past the duty-free counters selling liquor and perfume, past the luggage stores and fashion boutiques, past the place that offers neck massage. Still, I can&#x2019;t find an airport bookstore. Now, over the loudspeakers, comes the final call for my flight. &#x201c;Flight ninety-seven to Perth is ready for departure. All passengers must be on board at this time.&#x201d; They even call me by name. Panic sets in as I realize that I am almost certainly going to miss my flight. But the idea of hours on a plane without a book? Intolerable. So I run and run, searching for that bookstore&#x2014;or at least a newsstand with a rack of paperbacks. I can&#x2019;t find a single book anywhere in the airport. I start to scream.&nbsp;<br><br> Then I wake up.&nbsp;<br><br> I don&#x2019;t have this dream about food or television or movies or music. My unconscious is largely untroubled by the idea of spending hours in a metal tube hurtling through the sky without something to eat or a program to watch or tunes in my ears. It&#x2019;s the thought of being bookless for hours that jolts me awake in a cold sweat.&nbsp;<br><br> Throughout my life I&#x2019;ve looked to books for all sorts of reasons: to comfort me, to amuse me, to distract me, and to educate me. But just because you know that you can find anything you need in a book doesn&#x2019;t mean you can easily find your way to the right book at the right time, the one that tells you what you need to know or feel when you need to know or feel it.&nbsp;<br><br> A few years ago, I wrote a book about the books I read with my mother when she was dying of pancreatic cancer. During this time we read casually, promiscuously, and whimsically, allowing one book to lead us to the next. We read books we were given and books that had sat on our shelves for decades, waiting to be noticed; books we had stumbled across, and books we had chosen to reread simply because we felt like it. Were we looking for anything in particular? Usually not. At times, the books gave us something to talk about when we wanted to talk about anything rather than her illness. But they also gave us a way to talk about subjects that were too painful to address directly. They helped guide and prompt our conversations, so that I could learn as much as I could from my mother while she was still here to teach me.&nbsp;<br><br> At other times throughout my life, though, I&#x2019;ve felt a very specific need and have searched for a book to answer it. It hasn&#x2019;t always been easy to find the right book. Sure, when that burning need was to learn how to make a pineapple upside-down cake, I turned to <i>The Cake Bible. </i>Or when it was a need to find a place to eat in Chicago, the <i>Zagat </i>guide. Or when I wanted to self-diagnose that angry rash, to the <i>Mayo Clinic Family Health Book. </i>More and more, when I need this kind of information, my first line of attack isn&#x2019;t a book at all&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the Internet, or social media, where I quiz the ubiquitous &#x201c;hive mind&#x201d; to find, say, good Malaysian food near Union Square.&nbsp;<br><br> There are, however, questions that the Internet and the hive mind are spectacularly unable to answer to my satisfaction. These are the big ones, the ones that writers have been tackling for thousands of years: the problem of pain, meaning, purpose, happiness. Questions about how to live your life. Yes, the Internet tries to help&#x2014;inasmuch as any inanimate thing can be said to try to do anything. There are digital video channels devoted to streaming inspirational speeches from conferences in which people package insight into brief uplifting lectures&#x2014;many with a compelling hook and some memorable stories. But the best of these are often simply digests of&#x2014; or advertisements for&#x2014;a book that the presenter has written or is currently working on. Authors have always given lectures: there&#x2019;s nothing new in that. And readers, after hearing such speeches, have craved the books that go with them, so that they could explore the topics in greater depth and engage with them more fully&#x2014;working through the arguments at their own pace, skipping, savoring, and pondering.&nbsp;<br><br> Unlike most of these inspirational speeches, even the best of which tend to be largely self-referential, most good books are not tackling big questions in isolation. Great authors have been engaged in a dialogue with one another that stretches back for millennia. People who write books generally read books, and most books carry with them traces of some of the hundreds or thousands of books the writer read before attempting the one at hand.&nbsp;<br><br> And that&#x2019;s also why books can echo for centuries into the future. Even a book read by only a dozen people can have a massive effect if one of those readers goes on to write a book read by millions. British writer Henry Green (real name: Henry Vincent Yorke) never sold more than a few thousand copies of any of his novels, and most of his books sold far fewer than that. But the writers influenced by Green include Sebastian Faulks (whose <i>Birdsong </i>is one of the bestselling and most beloved British novels of all time), Eudora Welty, and Anthony Burgess (best known for <i>A Clockwork Orange, </i>which remains as shocking today as it was in 1962, when it was first published). John Updike wrote that Green&#x2019;s novels made &#x201c;more of a stylistic impact on me than those of any writer living or dead.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Henry Green died at age sixty-eight in 1973 and is largely forgotten. The books he influenced continue to be read and themselves inspire new works.&nbsp;<br> Sometimes books wear their influences loudly, mention- ing other books by name, like <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. </i>Sometimes the lineage is subtler, and the careful reader must tease out or guess at the influences. (How much of J. K. Row- ling&#x2019;s Harry Potter series was inspired by the classic 1857 boarding-school novel <i>Tom Brown&#x2019;s School Days, </i>by Thomas Hughes?) And sometimes authors hint at influences that aren&#x2019;t really influences at all but instead speak to the kind of book the author would have <i>liked </i>to have written.&nbsp;<br><br> Whenever I read, I try to be aware of these echoes and associations and aspirations. How did this book come to be? What books does this book resemble, and what books does it bring to mind?&nbsp;<br> Then, as the reader, I become influenced while I&#x2019;m read- ing. I&#x2019;m not the same reader when I finish a book as I was when I started. Brains are tangles of pathways, and reading creates new ones. Every book changes your life. So I like to ask: How is this book changing mine?&nbsp;<br> At the trial in which he would be sentenced to death, Socrates (as quoted by Plato) said that the unexamined life isn&#x2019;t worth living. Reading is the best way I know to learn how to examine your life. By comparing what you&#x2019;ve done to what others have done, and your thoughts and theories and feelings to those of others, you learn about yourself and the world around you. Perhaps that is why reading is one of the few things you do alone that can make you feel less alone; it&#x2019;s a solitary activity that connects you to others.&nbsp;<br><br> At fifty-four, I&#x2019;m now roughly the same age Dante was when he was putting the finishing touches on <i>The Divine Comedy. </i>I&#x2019;m the same age as von Aschenbach in Thomas Mann&#x2019;s <i>Death in Venice. </i>(I realized only recently that the character in this novella who was pining for a youth and his own lost youth was squarely in middle age; not having read the open- ing very carefully, I had always assumed that the &#x201c;old&#x201d; man who allowed the hotel barber to dye his hair jet black and garishly paint his face was in his seventies at the very least.) Fifty-plus is a good age for big questions. Unless I&#x2019;m that rare soul who makes it past one hundred, I probably have less time ahead of me than I&#x2019;ve already lived. Now that my brother, sister, and I are all over fifty, my brother, using a golf analogy, refers to our lives as being played on the back nine&#x2014;the first nine holes are behind us. Whatever score we&#x2019;ve accumulated, we carry with us. Suddenly, finishing honorably and staying out of the sand traps and water hazards matters more than seeing our names on the leaderboard.&nbsp;<br><br> On the other hand, I think any age is a good age for big questions. I asked some of my biggest and best when I was in high school and college&#x2014;fittingly, as that&#x2019;s what school is for. I asked other big questions at painful times in my life&#x2014; no age is immune from misfortune or feels it less keenly. And I hope and expect to be asking big questions right up to the end.&nbsp;<br> I know I&#x2019;m not alone in my hunger for books to help me find the right questions to ask, and find answers to the ones that I have. Because I work in publishing and wrote a book about reading, I meet a lot of readers. Readers of all ages have shared with me their desire for a list of books to help guide them. I&#x2019;ve heard from people who want classic novels to read; others just how-to books; others a list of titles from around the world. But most don&#x2019;t care what type of book or when it was written or by whom&#x2014;they just want books that will help them find their way in the world and give them pleasure while they are at it.&nbsp;<br><br> On an endless and turbulent plane ride from New York to Las Vegas, I sat next to a nineteen-year-old West Point plebe. We started chatting, and he soon was telling me about some of his favorite books; <i>The Alchemist </i>by Paulo Coelho was one. I told him I also loved that fable of the shepherd who travels to Egypt in search of treasure. Our conversation quickly moved from pleasantries to the meaning of life. (Maybe <i>The Alchemist </i>prompted that; maybe it was because the turbulence was increasingly extreme.) As the plane bounced around the sky, I began to babble about other books that had inspired me. The cadet said he would trade me a genuine West Point baseball cap for a list of my favorite titles. I can&#x2019;t remember most of what I wrote down. I love the cap; I hope he liked the books.&nbsp;<br><br> And then there&#x2019;s my ninety-six-year-old friend Else, who is always ravenous for book recommendations. Recently, I told her about a book by Ruth Ozeki called <i>A Tale for the Time Being. </i>In this novel from 2013, a writer in the Pacific Northwest finds washed up on shore various items, including the diary of a sixteen-year-old girl in Tokyo who is being horribly bullied and is quite sure she doesn&#x2019;t want to go on living. The novel moves between the story of the writer, passages from the girl&#x2019;s diary, and a collection of letters that accompanied it. The most indelible character in the book is the girl&#x2019;s hundred-and-four-year-old grandmother, a quietly charismatic Zen Buddhist nun with a fascinating past, who provides physical and emotional sanctuary when life becomes too awful for the girl to bear alone.&nbsp;<br><br> Else also has enormous charisma, but of a more boisterous variety. (That is, she swears a lot.) And she too has lived a remarkable life: a teenage refugee from Nazi Germany, she became a music editor for film. Else read <i>A Tale for the Time Being </i>with delight and had much to say about it. But more than anything she wanted to discuss the hundred-and-four-year-old Buddhist nun. Else hung on to her every word, and declared her one of the most astonishing characters she had ever encountered in fiction or nonfiction&#x2014;or in real life, for that matter. &#x201c;Now I know who I want to be when I grow up,&#x201d; she announced to me gleefully, laughing and clapping her hands together.&nbsp;<br> As for me, I&#x2019;m on a search&#x2014;and have been, I now realize, all my life&#x2014;to find books to help me make sense of the world, to help me become a better person, to help me get my head around the big questions that I have and answer some of the small ones while I&#x2019;m at it.&nbsp;<br><br> I know that the West Point cadet, Else, and millions of others are on this search, too, a search that began long before I was born and that will continue long after I&#x2019;m gone.&nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m not a particularly disciplined or systematic seeker. I don&#x2019;t give a great deal of thought to the books I choose&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll read anything that catches my eye. Most of the time when I choose what I&#x2019;m going to read it has absolutely nothing to do with improving myself. Especially when I&#x2019;m at my happiest, I&#x2019;m unlikely to search for a book to make me happier. But it&#x2019;s often during these periods of nonseeking that I&#x2019;ve stumbled across a book that has changed my life.&nbsp;<br><br> I believe that everything you need to know you can find in a book. People have always received life-guiding wisdom from certain types of nonfiction, often from &#x201c;self-help&#x201d; books starting with the progenitor of the category, Samuel Smiles&#x2019;s 1859 bestseller <i>Self-Help </i>(<i>with illustrations of Character and Conduct</i>)<i>. </i>But I have found that all sorts of books can carry this kind of wisdom; a random sentence in a thriller will give me unexpected insight. (If I hadn&#x2019;t read <i>Killing Floor, </i>the masterful 1997 novel that introduced the world to Jack Reacher, a former military cop turned vagrant, I never would have learned this valuable piece of wisdom, which still guides me in work and life: &#x201c;Waiting is a skill like anything else.&#x201d;)&nbsp;<br><br> I also believe that there is no book so bad that you can&#x2019;t find anything in it of interest. That, actually, is a paraphrase from the Roman lawyer Pliny the Younger, a sentiment later adopted by Miguel de Cervantes in <i>Don Quixote. </i>Admittedly, neither Pliny nor Cervantes were subject to some of the weakest &#x201c;sex and shopping&#x201d; books from the 1980s, but I still think it mostly holds true. You can learn something from the very worst books&#x2014;even if it is just how crass and base, or boring and petty, or cruel and intolerant, the human race can be. Or even if it&#x2019;s just one gleaming insight in a muddy river of words.&nbsp;<br><br> There is a proud tradition of extracting lines from poetry and songs and using them in this way. And for centuries, people have kept &#x201c;commonplace books&#x201d;: journals filled with transcriptions of quotes and extracts. But not everyone is a fan of cherry-picking odd passages from random books and using them to direct your life. Some people argue that lines from novels and plays are dependent on the context that surrounds them&#x2014;that it&#x2019;s unseemly and self-serving to grab the odd line here and there, especially if it comes in the voice of a character and may not have anything to do with what the writer thinks. I don&#x2019;t buy this. It ignores the way that your brain collects, refracts, sorts, and combines information. Our search for meaning isn&#x2019;t limited to thoughts that were created to be meaningful and packaged in verse or easily extractable chunks. We can find meaning in everything&#x2014;and everything is fair game. Your brain is, in fact, the ultimate commonplace collection, and everything you&#x2019;ve ever read is in there somewhere, ready to come back into your consciousness when you want or need it.&amp;n...</p><h2>Artful Color, Mindful Knits: The Definitive Guide to Working with Hand-dyed Yarn</h2><p>With expert instruction in the use of hand-dyed yarn, this pattern book gives knitters and crocheters the edge they need to stitch with confidence. Working with artisan hand-dyed yarn opens a world of possibility for a crafter, but problems can arise if the patterning is accidental, inconsistent, or unattractive. The author shows how to analyze the dye skein and reveal its color repeat, allowing the crafter to employ stitch gauge and stitch count to intentionally pattern the finished work. As a contrast, further strategies and stitch choices are shown that blend the colors to overcome unwanted pooling and create more gentle gradients. With 40 patterns for a wide variety of projects, this manual will have crafters constructing vibrant scarves, shawls, kimonos, and more.</p><p><b>Laura Militzer Bryant </b>is a designer and fiber arts crafting teacher whose work has appeared regularly in <i>Interweave Knits</i>, <i>Knitter&#x2019;s Magazine</i>, and <i>Vogue Knitting</i>.

They both live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.Spring 14 I have to confess, when I wanted to knit with a hand-dyed skein of yarn I would cast on a simple stitch pattern and hope. Sometimes it looked OK, but sometimes not as inspiring as the skein itself. No longer! Laura is quite a bit more scientific. In order to get the colours of a hand-dyed skein to fall predictably, she knits or crochets a multiple or fraction of the original dye repeat length, or magic number. An exact repeat gives colour stacking. One or two stitches difference from the magic number produces diagonal stripes or a diamond Argyle effect. Different stitch patterns and different placement of colour on the yarn also give surprising results. A limitation of this technique is that you can't increase and decrease stitches for shaping, but the author includes some example patterns showing how these straight widths can be joined into garments with panels of toning solids. If want something truly random or less bold - without any pooling or patterns, this also cannot be left to chance - Laura details different techniques for achieving `randomness' such as slip-stitch patterns, floats, and knitting into the row below. She combines handdyed yarns and solids on different rows and within the same stitch. The fabric that results is more homogeneous, but still retains the proportions of the original colours. Laura illustrates the various effects using case studies with commercially dyed yarn in different repeat sizes and colour configurations, showing her experimentation samples and the final garment. Hand-dyed yarn can also be used to achieve these effects. Before dyeing, yarn can be skeined to the correct size to achieve the fabric width that you want. Just to prove it worked, I had to dig out a hand-dyed skein from my stash immediately and cast on a cowl.

He soon became disillusioned with the foreign missionary community and began a new spiritual quest, adopting Indian dress, forgoing the privileges of a Westerner in colonial India, and founding a mendicant religious brotherhood. Later in life he married a Rajput Christian girl, converted to Hinduism, and adopted a new name. Stokes became a leader in Gandhi's independence movement in the 1920s, and was the only American jailed by the British for this cause. He is most often remembered in India, however, as the man who introduced American Delicious apples to the Himalayas. An American in Gandhi's India draws on oral history and interviews as well as Stokes's books, journals, and letters. Sharma's fascinating account offers a rare glimpse into a century of interaction between India and the United States.</p></p><p>"Sharma has written a lively and philosophical book, reflecting closely Stokes's mixed personality and steely commitment." --Michael Fathers, <i>Time Asia</i><p> "This is . . . the story of the commitment to India that prompted Gandhi to describe Stokes as a foreigner who had made India his home, 'in a manner in which perhaps no other American or Englishman has.'" --Mark Tully, <i>India Today</i></p><p> "Of the men and women from foreign climes who came to India to preach and stayed to learn, the name of Samuel Stokes is an outstanding one." --Chanchal Sarkar, <i>Hindustan Times</i></p><p> "The fascinating story of Samuel Evans Stokes is a meticulously documented and well-written book." --H.

His mother, Olympias, and his father, King Philip of Macedon, fought each other for their son's loyalty, teaching Alexander politics and vengeance from the cradle. His love for the youth Hephaistion taught him trust, while Aristotle's tutoring provoked his mind and Homer's "Iliad fueled his aspirations. Killing his first man in battle at the age of twelve, he became regent at sixteen and commander of Macedon's cavalry at eighteen, so that by the time his father was murdered, Alexander's skills had grown to match his fiery ambition.Mary Renault was born in London and educated at Oxford. She then trained for three years as a nurse, and wrote her first published novel, <b>Promise of Love</b>. Her next three novels were written while serving in WWII. After the war, she settled in South Africa and traveled considerably in Africa and Greece. It was at this time that she began writing her brilliant historical reconstructions of ancient Greece, including <b>The King Must Die, The Last of the Wine</b>, and <b>The Persian Boy</b>.

She married Almanzo Wilder in 1885; their only daughter, Rose, was born the following year. The Wilders moved to Rocky Ridge Farm at Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894, where they established a permanent home.

The One who comes as visitor and guest becomes host and offers a hospitality in which the entire world can become truly human, be at home, and know salvation in the depths of their hearts. In <i>The Hospitality of God</i> Brendan Byrne, SJ, provides to-the-point commentary on those parts of Luke's Gospel that bring home to people a sense of the extravagance of God's love for them.</p><p><i>The Hospitality of God</i> approaches Luke's Gospel through the interpretive key of "hospitality." It looks at the Gospel as a whole, yet lingers upon scenes where the theme of "hospitality" is particularly prominent, such as the infancy stories, Jesus at Nazareth, Jesus in the house of Simon, the Good Samaritan, Martha and Mary, the banquet in 14:1-35, the Prodigal Son, Jesus' visit to the tax collector Zacchaeus, the institution of the Eucharist, and the Emmaus event.</p><p>Byrne stresses that those in Luke's Gospel who readily offer hospitality - chiefly the marginalized and the poor - find themselves drawn into a much deeper sphere of hospitality, the hospitality of God. Those who have difficulty sharing are challenged by Jesus to conversion so that they, too, may not be left out of the banquet of life to which God calls all human beings. Luke's Gospel, ever interested in the process of human transformation, explores this resistance to God's gift and the ways in which individuals need to be converted if they are to come to "knowledge of salvation."</p><p>Luke's Gospel is written out of faith in the risen Lord.

The orcish Horde&#x2019;s violent invasion of the Eastern Kingdoms stands as one of history&#x2019;s most tumultuous periods. Through the Burning Legion&#x2019;s demonic machinations, the once-noble orcs were transformed into a nearly unstoppable foe and let loose upon Azeroth&#x2019;s unsuspecting denizens. Yet even in the face of the Horde&#x2019;s unparalleled fury, brave heroes risked everything to rise up in defense of the . . . <br><br><b>Rise of the Horde</b><b>:</b> Before the savage orcs began their rampage across Azeroth, they were a proud shamanic race native to the world of Draenor. The cunning demon Kil&#x2019;jaeden saw lethal potential in the clan-based orcs, and thus he set about molding them into the Horde&#x2014;a single, brutal force driven by an all-consuming thirst for destruction. But the foul demonic magic that granted the Horde its immense strength began consuming the orcs from within, ultimately threatening to destroy everything that they once were. <br><br><b>The Last Guardian:</b> Long ago a group of magi known as the Council of Tirisfal was formed to fight a secret war against the sinister demons of the Burning Legion. To this end, the council imbued a single champion with enormous power to act as the world&#x2019;s guardian. Medivh was one such Guardian of Tirisfal, and he was expected to be the greatest who had ever lived. Yet he was destined to follow a much darker path. From birth a mysterious evil had tainted the core of his being, and his subsequent struggle against the darkness within himself would precipitate the orcish Horde&#x2019;s invasion of Azeroth . . . and change the world forever. <br><br><b>Tides of Darkness:</b> During the First War, the orcish Horde laid waste to the once-great human kingdom of Stormwind. From the ashes of this terrible defeat, however, hope emerged. Anduin Lothar, Champion of Stormwind, rallied the survivors of his ruined homeland and valiantly led them to Lordaeron in the hopes of uniting the human nations into a mighty Alliance that could stand against the Horde and its ruthless new leader, Orgrim Doomhammer. Yet as formidable as Lothar believed the Alliance would be, many humans feared that no force would ever be capable of stopping the Horde&#x2019;s merciless onslaught. <br><br><b>Beyond the Dark Portal:</b> In the aftermath of the Second War between orcs and humans, the Dark Portal, a gateway connecting Azeroth to Draenor, was destroyed. The orcs, however, did not abandon their lust for war. Led by the mysterious orc shaman Ner&#x2019;zhul, a fresh wave of Horde fighters flooded into Azeroth. Even more unsettling was that small bands of orcs intent on something other than mere conquest began scouring Azeroth for powerful artifacts desired by their sinister leader. To counter the Horde&#x2019;s dark schemes, only one option remained for the Alliance: a suicide mission into the orcs&#x2019; ruined homeworld of Draenor.</p><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling and award-winning author Christie Golden has written more than forty novels and several short stories in the fields of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.

Cerise had known it from the moment she entered the strangely neat apartment, the inevitable clutter--disks, books and papers, here a sweater, there a pair of shoes--all missing along with Trouble. She went through the two rooms in the greyed light of the winter afternoon, checked the single closet and the battered trunks that held the rest of their clothes, not looking at the computers until the last, already sure of what she would find. Half the system was gone, Trouble's half, the portable holo-multex drive and the brainbox and the braid of cables and biojacks that carried signals to the implanted processors in their brains. There was no paper note.<br>A light was flashing on the media console, and she touched the code keys to retrieve the single message. The voice that broke from the speaker was familiar, but not Trouble--Carlie, babbling on about something she couldn't be bothered to hear right now--and she killed the message, not bothering to save it for later. She turned away from the wall of blank screens and cubbies filled with data decks and players, the ugly oyster-grey carpet squeaking underfoot, and looked around the little room as though she was seeing it for the first time. Outside the single window, the sun was setting beyond the buildings on the far side of the little park, throwing a last cold light across the grey stone and concrete. A reflection like a spark flared from the highest side windows of the Lomaro Building half a mile away--three-quarters of a kilometer, she corrected automatically--and faded as she stared. The sun dropped into a bank of dirty cloud, and the light went out as though someone had flicked a switch. On the horizon, beyond the five- and six-story buildings of the local neighborhood, neon flickered to life, running like lightning along the edges of the buildings.<br>She shivered, and reached overhead into the web of invisible control beams that crisscrossed the apartment, waved her hand twice to bring on the main light. A yellow light flashed on the display by the door instead, warning her that she hadn't replaced the main battery. She swore under her breath--that had been Trouble's chore--and went to the panel herself, switched light and heat to full and touched the button that brought the opaque screen down over the window. It was sheer indulgence, this system, costing at least two months' rent to install, but once the security--black security, black-market and blackest-night effective, run off an illegal direct-line power tap--had been in place, it had seemed a shame not to install the convenience systems as well. She remembered Trouble balancing on an uneven chair beside the door, drill-driver in hand, bolting the last of the extra control boxes into place. That had been their indulgence for a job well done, right before the hearings began, three months before David Terrel was actually convicted of armed robbery because of a particularly brutal icebreaker he carried in his toolkit. The last good times, she thought, feeling at the moment only the cold, and turned back to the dismantled machines.<br>Seeing the system broken, the empty spaces where Trouble's machines had been, made her shiver again, something like fear or rage or sorrow threatening to break through the numbness, but she shoved the feeling down again, and went back into the bedroom for the things she needed to repair the gaps. She had spares of everything that Trouble had taken, machines she had used before she'd met Trouble, and she hauled their case out from under the bed, brushing dust from the lids. The wind moaned through the rungs of the fire escape that slanted down past the bedroom window; she glanced at it, hearing loose bolts rattle on the landing one story above, and went back into the outer room.<br>It didn't take long to rebuild the system. Trouble had worked with her usual precision, taking nothing that wasn't hers, leaving the backup disks stacked prominently in front of the dusty keyboard. There was a hollyblock there, too, holographic storage, and Cerise moved it impatiently aside to plug her own holodrive into the multiple sockets. She replaced Trouble's dedicated brainbox with her own--an older model, but still serviceable, still fast enough to let her run the nets without danger--and found a length of cable to reconnect the various components. She looked at the hollyblock, but did not pick it up, turned instead to the rarely used keyboard and began methodically to recreate her machine.<br>The screen lit and windowed as she worked, giving her a schematic view of the reconstructed system; she touched keys, reestablishing virtual links that had been broken when the physical links were removed, and watched the schematic shift, rotating in the uppermost window to show her the new links outlined in red. A string of text asked for confirmation. She gave it the code it wanted, and watched as the red lines slowly turned to yellow and then to green, blending in with the rest of the design. When she was sure it was complete, she dismissed that image, and sorted through the directories until she found her private mailbox. It took two keys to open it, one a name--she made a mental note to change that--the other a meaningless string of letters, but she found nothing new in the lists of files. That was as she'd expected, and she closed the program, reaching instead for the hollyblock. If Trouble had left her anything, any explanation, it would be there.<br>She fitted the box carefully into the replacement multex drive, and touched the keys that initiated the test sequence. Everything came back green, and she pressed a second set of keys to access the drive. A dozen files, each indicated by an individual symbol, an icon, bloomed on her screen. She frowned then--she had expected more, some message, some more useful labels, something--but touched the first icon. The file blossomed in front of her, filling the screen with a peculiar half-squashed half-stretched image that she recognized at once as the two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional network file--of their network map, she realized suddenly, of the map she and Trouble had painstakingly built over the four years of their partnership. It was one of their more useful tools: there were no commercial maps available--not covering all the nets--and the ones that did exist were deliberately flawed, deliberately distorted to hide the control areas from people who had no business having access. And there were plenty of corporate spaces, privately owned systems that nonetheless also existed in the unreal "space" of the myriad networked computers that was the nets; all of those preferred to be invisible, at least to an outside eye.<br>On the net itself, of course, things were different. Once you plugged yourself into the system--either via the implanted dollie--box and dollie-slot, the direct-on-line-image processor system, which gave a text-speech-and-symbol interface, or through the full-sense brainworm, with its molecular wires running directly into the brain that let you experience virtuality as though it were real--it was easy enough to find your way around the nets. There were signposts, vivid neon images, and the swirling rivers and lines of light that were the virtual reflection of the data itself, which anyone who'd been on the nets for any length of time could read like a tracker read spoor. But the map was useful for planning a job, when you had to enter the nets from the safest point, so that the security programs, watchdogs and trackers and callback systems, and all the panoply of IC(E)--Intrusion Countermeasures (Electronic)--would either lose your trail in the confusion of conflicting data or never have the chance to track you down. Remotely, Cerise was surprised that Trouble had taken the copy with her, though she supposed it was possible that Trouble had made two copies out of the network files, their own secure space. But then, Trouble had said it was time to give up cracking.<br>It was very quiet in the apartment, too quiet, just the distant sound of wind and the occasional rattle of the fire escape in the other room. Cerise winced, and reached for the main remote, jabbed at buttons until the media center lit. Trouble had left the main screen turned to the news channel, and the blare of the announcer's voice filled the room.<br>"--top story, the Senate today voted to override the presidential veto of the Evans-Tindale Bill, joining the House in handing the president a resounding defeat. Marjorie Albuez in Washington has more on the story."<br>"Thank you, Jim. By accepting the compromise bill sponsored by Charles Evans and Alexander Tindale, Congress today seems to have ensured that the United States will remain the only industrial nation that is not a signatory to the Amsterdam Network Conventions."<br>The voice droned on, but Cerise was no longer listening. She swung back to face the linked computers, the remaining files forgotten, and reached for the dollie-cord snugged into its housing at the base of the dedicated brainbox. She tilted her head to fit the cord into the dollie-slot behind her right ear, but did not launch herself directly onto the nets. This was why Trouble had left. She had been talking for months about what would happen if the U.S. rejected the Amsterdam Conventions, about how even the supposedly benign Evans-Tindale Bill would destroy the cracker community, bring them all finally under an alien, ill-conceived, ill-fitting law. For a moment, Cerise almost believed those prophecies of doom. No one had believed that Congress would buy Evans-Tindale, it bore no relation to virtuality....<br>"--completes what the so-called Nunberg Act--the Industrial Espionage Act, as it is more properly known--attempted to provide two years ago." That was a new voice, but Cerise didn't turn to identify the speaker. "The Evans-Tindale Bill codifies the various provisions of the Nunberg Act, and creates a new entity within the Treasury Department that will have enforcement responsibility on the nets, replacing the patchwork system currently in place. In a nutshell, Evans-Tindale, like the Nunberg Act before ...</p><h2>Basara, Vol. 27: Final Volume!

She grew up in Collegeville, PA, and traveled extensively before settling on Nantucket, which has been the setting for her seven previous novels.

When the MacAvoys set sail alone for Martha&#39;s Vineyard to celebrate their anniversary, tragedy strikes--and the question of murder arises. Hale&#39;s stylistic portrayals give each character a distinct voice and a credible set of circumstances. However, the plot is somewhat overdone, and the novel would be better as an abridgment.

"[T]here's nothing for me to do, nowhere I'd care to go, and hardly anything worth seeing." This bored, <i>bored</i> young protagonist who can't see the point to anything is knocked out of his glum humdrum by the sudden and curious appearance of a tollbooth in his bedroom. Since Milo has absolutely nothing better to do, he dusts off his toy car, pays the toll, and drives through. What ensues is a journey of mythic proportions, during which Milo encounters countless odd characters who are anything but dull.<p> Norton Juster received (and continues to receive) enormous praise for this original, witty, and oftentimes hilarious novel, first published in 1961. In an introductory "Appreciation" written by Maurice Sendak for the 35th anniversary edition, he states, "<i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i> leaps, soars, and abounds in right notes all over the place, as any proper masterpiece must." Indeed.</p><p> As Milo heads toward Dictionopolis he meets with the Whether Man ("for after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the weather will be"), passes through The Doldrums (populated by Lethargarians), and picks up a watchdog named Tock (who has a giant alarm clock for a body). The brilliant satire and double entendre intensifies in the Word Market, where after a brief scuffle with Officer Short Shrift, Milo and Tock set off toward the Mountains of Ignorance to rescue the twin Princesses, Rhyme and Reason. Anyone with an appreciation for language, irony, or <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>-style adventure will adore this book for years on end. <i>(Ages 8 and up)</i></p>Illustrated in black-and-white. This ingenious fantasy centers around Milo, a bored ten-year-old who comes home to find a large toy tollbooth sitting in his room. Joining forces with a watchdog named Tock, Milo drives through the tollbooth&#39;s gates and begins a memorable journey. He meets such characters as the foolish, yet lovable Humbug, the Mathemagician, and the not-so-wicked &#34;Which,&#34; Faintly Macabre, who gives Milo the &#34;impossible&#34; mission of returning two princesses to the Kingdom of Wisdom.</p><h2>Nietzsche as Philosopher</h2><p><p>"With skill and discernment Danto reveals the important strands of Nietzsche's wildly tangled skein and weaves them into a pattern." -- <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><p>First published in 1965, Danto&#39;s study argues that Nietzsche offers a systematic and coherent philosophy, anticipating many of the questions that define contemporary philosophy. Danto&#39;s commentaries helped canonize Nietzsche as a philosopher and continue to illuminate subtleties in Nietzsche&#39;s work as well as his immense contributions to the philosophies of science, language, and logic.

As such, they are striking and unusual, strange, powerful and urgent. Monica Furlong uses key selections from among these women's own writings and writings about them by their contemporaries, along with her own assessment of them, to open up their contributions to a wide popular audience. The eleven women represented in this anthology were housewives, visionaries, abbesses, beguines, recluses, and nuns who wrote between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries. They include: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; H�loise, the scholar and abbess, whose letters to Abelard are treasure of medieval literature <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Hildegard of Bingen, the visionary Rhineland nun <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Clare of Assisi, the close friend of Saint Francis and founder of the Poor Clares <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Catherine of Siena, an influential spiritual counselor whose book, <i> Dialogue, </i> consists of a debate between herself and God <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Julian of Norwich, the English hermitess who spent the greater part of her life meditating on and coming to understand the striking visions she received as a young woman <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; and many others</p><p>Monica Furlong is the author of numerous books, including <i>Merton: A Biography, Therese of Lisieux, </i>and <i>Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts. </i>"Furlong's anthology is distinguished by the range of material. It not only sharpens understanding of medieval mysticism but also enhances our vision in a world where mysticism and longing remain intimately intertwined."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> <br><br>"An excellent guide."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br><br>"Mystics are not normal people," opines British novelist and biographer Monica Furlong in this introduction to ten mystics and one wronged woman from the high Middle Ages. Furlong's mystical women defy parents, loathe sex, obsess over distant sins, hear voices, seek pain, and occasionally strip themselves bare in public places. But their abnormalities are not incapacitating&#x2014;they also establish monastic communities, confront popes, and produce literature that is still published today, centuries after their normal contemporaries have been forgotten. <br><br>"Furlong, whose previous biographical subjects include John Bunyan, Therese of Lisieux, Thomas Merton, and Alan Watts, writes not only as a scholar but as one who has been personally touched my medieval mystical vision: 'the conviction that there is a reality, a profound meaning, behind or beyond or within the world of appearances.' These strange women fascinate her; she wants to introduce them to readers who might be intimidated by dusty original sources. And so, in her own words and theirs, Furlong sketches rebellious Heloise (the one nonmystic in the sorority), runaway Christina of Markyate, a visionary Hildegard of Bingen, the lovesick Beguines, sickly Clare of Assisi, joyful Angela of Foligno, strong-willed Catherine of Siena, mad Margery Kemp, and optimistic Julian of Norwich. <br><br> "<i>Visions and Longings </i> is an anecdotal introduction to mysticism; Furlong has no interest in providing theological history or analyzing these women's stories in light of their tumultuous political contexts. Rather, despite her assertion that her heroines are 'bizarre and extraordinarily unlike ourselves,' she hold them up as contemporary role models: autonomous, subversive, powerful, independent, and adamantly antihierarchical. If this approach occasionally leads toward anachronism, it may also facilitate appreciation and understanding of times past. It may even stimulate critical thinking about today's popular spirituality titles that promise improved health and happiness&#x2014;a kind of mystical wholeness&#x2014;as a side effect of divine union. By contrast, the mystical women of Christian tradition sought nothing of the sort, finding union with God in spite of&#x2014;or even through&#x2014;illness and suffering. 'It may be,' Furlong suggests, 'that through wounds in the psyche, cracks in the personality, neurotic or psychotic traits, through depression and hysteria and paranoia, a way is made for the transcendent to reach into the human condition.'"&#x2014;LaVonne Neff, <i>Books &amp; Culture </i></p><h2>Month-By-Month Gardening in the Desert Southwest</h2><p>Do I prune my hydrangea in the fall or do I wait until early spring?<br>When is it safe to put out tomatoes?<br>Can I divide iris now? <p>If you have ever asked yourself questions like these, "Month-by-Month Gardening in?The Desert Southwest "is for you.

Agatha Christie is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. It was her sharp observations of the ambitions that drive people, their relationships and the conflicts that erupt between them, that added life and sparkle to her ingenious detective novels. When she turned this understanding of human nature away from the crime genre, writing anonymously as Mary Westmacott to prove that her writing could sell on its merit rather than her fame alone, she created bittersweet novels, love stories with a jagged edge, as compelling and memorable as the best of her work. This omnibus gathers together the first three Mary Westmacott novels: Giant&#39;s Bread: When a gifted composer returns home after being reported killed in the war, he finds his wife has already remarried!

Montag, trained by the state to be a destroyer, throws away his can of kerosene and begins to read a book.</p><p>In <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, Ray Bradbury's classic, frightening vision of the future, firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury's vividly painted society holds up the appearance of happiness as the highest goal--a place where trivial information is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Fire Captain Beatty explains it this way, "Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs.... Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy." <p> Guy Montag is a book-burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. His wife spends all day with her television "family," imploring Montag to work harder so that they can afford a fourth TV wall. Their dull, empty life sharply contrasts with that of his next-door neighbor Clarisse, a young girl thrilled by the ideas in books, and more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless chatter of the tube. When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Montag is moved to make some changes, and starts hiding books in his home. Eventually, his wife turns him in, and he must answer the call to burn his secret cache of books. After fleeing to avoid arrest, Montag winds up joining an outlaw band of scholars who keep the contents of books in their heads, waiting for the time society will once again need the wisdom of literature.</p><p> Bradbury--the author of more than 500 short stories, novels, plays, and poems, including <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> and <i>The Illustrated Man</i>--is the winner of many awards, including the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America.

Her father, Oliver, was a penniless British sailor who rose to become a naval commander, and her mother, Olivia, had a prosperous Anglo-Irish background. Manning trained as a painter at the Portsmouth School of Art, then moved to London and turned to writing. She published her first novel under her own name in 1938 (she had published several potboilers in a local paper under the name Jacob Morrow while a teenager). The next year she married R.D. &#34;Reggie&#34; Smith, and the couple moved to Romania, where Smith was employed by the British Council. During World War II, the couple fled before the Nazi advance, first to Greece and then to Jerusalem, where they lived until the end of the war. Manning wrote several novels during the 1950s, but her first real success as a novelist was &#34;The Great Fortune&#34; (1960), the first of six books concerning Guy and Harriet Pringle, whose wartime experiences and troubled marriage echoed that of the diffident Manning and her gregarious husband. In the 1980s these novels were collected in two volumes, &#34;The Balkan Trilogy&#34; and &#34;The Levant Trilogy,&#34; known collectively as &#34;Fortunes of Wa&#34;r. In addition to her novels, Manning wrote essays and criticism, history, a screenplay, and a book about Burmese and Siamese cats. She was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1976, and died four years later. Rachel Cusk is the author of seven novels and two works of non-fiction.

Half a million people, or so the newspapers would report, crowded the streets between Battery Park and Fourteenth Street. If you were there among them that day, the thing that you would never forget&#x2014; not even if you lived to see the next century&#x2014; was the flags. The Stars and Stripes flew above the doors of department stores and town houses, from Bowery taverns and from the spire of Trinity Church, while Broadway, the <i>New York Herald </i>reported, &#x201c;was almost hidden in a cloud of flaggery.&#x201d; P. T. Barnum, not to be outdone, especially when he sensed an opportunity for attention, had strung an entire panoply of oversize banners across the thoroughfare. The national ensign even fl uttered, in miniature, on the heads of the horses straining to pull overloaded omnibuses through the throngs on Fifth Avenue. The one flag that everyone wanted to see<i>&#x2014; needed </i>to see&#x2014; was in Union Square itself, the unattainable point toward which all the shoving and sweating and jostling bodies strove. No fewer than five separate speakers&#x2019; platforms had been hastily erected there, and every so often, above the ceaseless din, you could catch a phrase or two: <i>&#x201c;that handful of loyal men . . . their gallant commander . . . the honor of their country . . .&#x201d;</i><br><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</i>If you managed somehow to clamber up onto the base of a beleaguered lamppost and emerge for a moment above the hats and bonnets of the multitude, you might glimpse what was propped up on the monument in the center of the square: cradled in General Washington&#x2019;s bronze arms, a torn and soot- stained flag on a splintered staff. (One hundred forty years later, in an eerie echo of that long- forgotten day, a later generation would gather around the same statue with candles and flowers in the aftermath of another attack on the nation.) Nearby, waving a bit stiffly to acknowledge the cheers, was a lean, gray-haired officer.1 But then you lost your tenuous foothold, the gray- haired officer and his flag vanished from sight, and you were down off the lamppost again, buffeted this way and that by the odorous masses of New Yorkers, ripened by exertion and by the sunny spring day: Wall Street bankers in black broadcloth; pale, flushed shopgirls; grimy men from the Fulton docks, more pungent than anyone else, smelling of fish. It was hard to imagine anybody swaggering through such a crowd, but here came someone doing just that&#x2014; and not just one man but three abreast, nonchalant young toughs all dressed in identical, baggy red shirts. One had a fat plug of tobacco in his cheek and looked ready to spit where he pleased; another fellow none too surreptitiously pinched the prettiest of the shopgirls as he passed. Somehow, by common consent, the pressing throngs parted to let them through. They all knew exactly who these superior beings were: the fire b&#x2019;hoys. And as of today, no longer simply that, either&#x2014; for these b&#x2019;hoys had signed their enlistment papers yesterday, and were very shortly to be sworn in as soldiers of the First New York Fire Zouaves.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way home after the great Union rally, you might have seen many more of them, over a thousand red- shirted recruits, crowding a park just off Fourteenth Street, arrayed in rough military formation. Uncharacteristically quiet, even subdued, they raised their brawny right arms as their colonel, the man they had just unanimously elected to lead them into war&#x2014;for such was the custom still, in those early months of 1861&#x2014;administered the oath.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young colonel&#x2014;he seemed, from a distance, barely more than a boy&#x2014;was, unlike all his thousand-odd comrades, not a New York City fireman. He was not even a New Yorker, unless one counted his childhood far upstate. He was different in almost every way from the strapping men of his regiment, with their loose limbs and salty tongues: a small man, neat and self- contained, who never drank, or smoked, or swore. He thrilled to poetry as much as to the tattoo of drums; he had dined at the White House more often than in taverns or mess halls; and he had come not from the teeming wards of Brooklyn but from the West.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was also one of those occasional American figures whose death, even more than his life, seemed to mark the passing away of one era and the beginning of another. He would be, briefly, the war&#x2019;s most famous man. And for that moment, the entire conflict, the irreconcilable forces that set state against state and brother against brother, would seem distilled into&#x2014;as one who knew him well would write&#x2014;&#x201c;the dark mystery of how Ellsworth died.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Like so m any Americans of his generation, Elmer Ellsworth seemed to emerge out of nowhere. This wasn&#x2019;t quite true, but almost. In later years, some would swear they had roomed with him in a cheap boardinghouse in Washington, long before he was famous; or been his classmate at a high school in Kenosha before he suddenly dropped out and disappeared; or known him living up among the Ottawa Indians near Muskegon, where the tribe had adopted him as its chief. But no one was ever quite sure.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odd remnants of his diaries would eventually turn up. And his parents, at least, who would long outlive him, eventually shared everything they could recall of his boyhood. He had left home early, though. There were few enough opportunities for him there.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellsworth was born in the year of the country&#x2019;s first great financial depression, 1837, in the small village of Malta in Saratoga County, New York. His ancestors had settled nearby before the Revolution, but the family was poor. Ephraim Ellsworth, the boy&#x2019;s father, had struggled as a tailor until the Panic ruined him, forcing him to eke out a living doing odd jobs, netting wild passenger pigeons to sell for their meat, and peddling kegs of pickled oysters door- to- door on commission. His son, serious- minded and small for his age, was sent off at the age of nine to work for a man who owned a general store and saloon. Scrupulously, the boy refused to handle liquor or even&#x2014;as his master expected&#x2014;to rinse out the customers&#x2019; whiskey glasses. In a world where drunkenness was common (among children, too), he had already resolved to be different.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His early life, Ellsworth would write as an adult, seemed to him nothing but &#x201c;a jumble of strange incidents.&#x201d; He was a child who seemed to live half in the gritty reality of his physical surroundings, half in a dream world of his own creation. Sometimes he cadged paint from a wagon shop in the village and daubed scenes onto a scrap of board or an old window shade. One of these has survived; it shows a forest- fringed river that might have been the nearby Hudson but for the turrets and spires of Arthurian castles rising along its banks. In summer, he wandered among the &#x201c;green old hills&#x201d; above the actual river, and in winter, he skated on the Champlain Canal, perhaps developing there the ease of movement that would later mature into a kind of balletic grace. His schooling must have been intermittent, and when he did attend, he was often teased; the other children nicknamed him &#x201c;Oyster Keg,&#x201d; on account of both his size and his father&#x2019;s ignominious occupation. The boy learned to defend his honor with his fists.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, though, the larger world offered glimpses of a reality nearly as glamorous as his painted fantasies. Malta lay astride the road to Saratoga Springs, a watering place popular with the officers and cadets of West Point, and in summer, the sprucely uniformed soldiers (with fine young women at their sides) must have passed through the village in hired carriages on their way to the nearby resort. For the watchful boy, the sight must have seemed a visitation from an imagined country. Many years later, Ellsworth&#x2019;s aunt would recall him making forts out of loose bricks and shaping mud into breastworks; wooden blocks represented American soldiers and enemy redcoats.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His grandfather, George Ellsworth, had been a teenage militiaman in the Revolution, and although George&#x2019;s pension application from the 1830s reveals that he was illiterate&#x2014;he signed the document with a quavering X&#x2014; it also shows that in old age he could still recount vivid tales of battling Tories and Indians along the Hudson Valley.6 Elmer&#x2019;s grandfather died when the boy was not yet three, but the old veteran&#x2019;s widow survived him by many years, and probably shared the stories she knew. The rocky slopes and tidy Dutch towns above the Hudson seemed themselves to tell tales of the many famous deeds they had witnessed. A boy with Ellsworth&#x2019;s active imagination, looking out over the placid landscape of fields and pastures, must sometimes have felt as if the cannons were still booming and the tomahawks still flying in the forests, somewhere over the next line of hills.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the boy was about eleven, his family moved to Mechanicville, a larger town with its own railroad station. Peddling the New York papers through the aisles of the crowded passenger cars, he must have scanned reports of the Mexican War and its aftermath, and of the liberal, nationalist revolutions in Europe, some of them sparked by student agitators not much older than he.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of these colorful stories in the penny papers, or perhaps from his boyhood sightings of West Point cadets, Ellsworth&#x2019;s dreams had early on taken a military cast. He organized the local boys into a militia company and somewhat grandiosely dubbed it the Black-Plumed Riflemen of Stillwater, the name stolen from a pulp novel he&#x2019;d read about the Revolutionary War.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon he was absent from home with increasing frequency, until finally, latching onto a prosperous- looking elderly gentleman who&#x2019;d taken an interest in him one day on the train, he followed the stranger off to New York City to work in his linen shop. This is where the biographical record suddenly stops.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we do know that he turned up eventually&#x2014;as perhaps he was bound to&#x2014;in Chicago. That town was in its restless adolescence in the 1850s, a half- wild place where patches of prairie still showed like blank canvas among the two- and three- story office buildings, and the occasional wolf still strayed in from the forested shores along Lake Michigan, to prowl the muddy streets and plank sidewalks.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restless, too, were the young men who roamed lean and hungry along those avenues of flimsy buildings. From villages in Ohio and western Pennsylvania, from New York and the stony farms of New England, from Germany and Ireland and Sweden, they crowded into the rising metropolis of the great West. Some found work in the sawmills that ran incessantly, gnawing virgin timber into clapboard and railroad ties; others amid the stench of the stockyards. Sometimes the tideless river ran viscous with the blood of slaughtered beasts.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A year or two before the outbreak of the war, Elmer Ellsworth was one of these thousands of young men, clerking and copying papers in a law office for meager pay, living on dry biscuits and water, sleeping on the bare wooden floor. It was a life so spartan that when he could get a pound or two of salted crackers to vary his diet, the occasion was worthy of note in his diary: &#x201c;Am living like a King.&#x201d; It was a statement of characteristic, wildly unrealistic, optimism. Through all the years of roving, wherever they had taken him, he had never lost his boyhood dreams of glory. In his free time, Ellsworth pored over volumes on military tactics and drill formations until he knew some of them by heart. Not long after his arrival in Chicago, he also joined a local militia, the Cadets of the National Guard, one of many such groups that drew in young men far from home and family, worn thin from hard work and striving, looking for anything solid to which they could fasten themselves.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, in an era of full-time, highly professionalized national armed forces, it is hard to appreciate the vastly different culture of the nineteenth century, when for most Americans, volunteering for military service was more like joining a weekend bowling league than enlisting in the army as we know it. The colonial militia companies, which had provided the rank and file during the Revolution, had faded away in the succeeding decades, especially after the War of 1812 had proven them no match for the British army&#x2019;s hardened veterans of the Napoleonic campaigns. But the Founding Fathers&#x2019; old vision of a United States without standing armies, in which citizen- soldiers were the first line of defense, still beckoned. In both cities and towns, men formed military companies that stood ready&#x2014; at least in theory&#x2014; to answer their country&#x2019;s call in case of emergency. In practice, most of these units were scarcely trained and haphazardly equipped; some marched with sticks or cornstalks instead of muskets. Members paraded on the village green every Fourth of July, unfurling tattered banners that had been stitched by local maidens who were now wrinkled grandmothers. The last serious mobilization had been the one back in 1812. Each month or two throughout the year, the boys gathered for &#x201c;drills&#x201d; that were often simply excuses to get away from home and do some hard drinking. Larger towns and cities had rival companies: one militia for the Democrats and another for the Whigs; one for the Methodists and another for the Presbyterians; one for the Irishmen and another for the Germans. New York City even had several all-Jewish units.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1850s, however, Americans started becoming a bit more serious about their militias, marching in drills and parades with fresh ardor, and even making sporadic attempts at professionalism. The Mexican War, the nation&#x2019;s most dramatic military victory since the Revolution, had just been fought and won. From Europe came reports of the glorious charges and sieges of the Crimean War, and of the nationalist struggles for independence. And closer to home, some Americans were sensing the approach of civil war and beginning to sharpen their swords&#x2014;in both the North and the South.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elmer Ellsworth does not appear to have been one of ...</p><h2>The Broken Ladder: How Inequality Affects the Way We Think, Live, and Die</h2><p><b>"A persuasive and highly readable account."&nbsp;&#x2014;President Barack Obama<br><br>&#x201c;Brilliant. . . . an important, fascinating read arguing that inequality creates a public health crisis in America.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;</b>Nicholas Kristof, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Broken Ladder</i>&nbsp;is an important, timely, and beautifully written account of how inequality affects us all.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Adam Alter, <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Irresistible</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Drunk Tank Pink</i></b><br><br>A timely examination by a leading scientist of the physical, psychological, and moral effects of inequality.&nbsp;<br></b><br>The levels of inequality in the world today are on a scale that have not been seen in our lifetimes, yet the disparity between rich and poor has ramifications that extend far beyond mere financial means. In <i>The Broken Ladder</i> psychologist Keith Payne examines how inequality divides us not just economically; it also has profound consequences for how we think, how we respond to stress, how our immune systems function, and even how we view moral concepts such as justice and fairness.<br><br>Research in psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics has not only revealed important new insights into how inequality changes people in predictable ways but also provided a corrective to the flawed view of poverty as being the result of individual character failings. Among modern developed societies, inequality is not primarily a matter of the actual amount of money people have. It is, rather, people's sense of where they stand in relation to others. Feeling poor matters&#x2014;not just being poor. Regardless of their average incomes, countries or states with greater levels of income inequality have much higher rates of all the social maladies we associate with poverty, including lower than average life expectancies, serious health problems, mental illness, and crime.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Broken Ladder</i> explores such issues as why women in poor societies often have more children, and why they have them at a younger age; why there is little trust among the working class in the prudence of investing for the future; why people's perception of their social status affects their political beliefs and leads to greater political divisions; how poverty raises stress levels as effectively as actual physical threats; how inequality in the workplace affects performance; and why unequal societies tend to become more religious. Understanding how inequality shapes our world can help us better understand what drives ideological divides, why high inequality makes the middle class feel left behind, and how to disconnect from the endless treadmill of social comparison.</p><p><b>Keith Payne</b>&nbsp;is a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an international leader in the psychology of inequality and discrimination.

Before that, my school had had the same cashier for as long as my fourth-grade mind could remember. I knew that some kids paid when they got to the register and others, like me, didn't. But the old lunch lady passed us through the line, money or not, as smoothly as our plastic trays glided over the rail. Then one day she was gone, replaced by a younger woman who seemed to be trying hard. As I carried my food past her, she stopped me and asked for $1.25. I felt off balance, the way you do when an elevator stops too quickly. I started stammering, the only thing I could do, since I had not a cent. I would gladly have given her any amount of cash at that moment simply to escape. At that point, an older woman, tall and skinny in a pink polo shirt, like a flamingo with a hairnet, leaned over and whispered in her ear, and I was waved through. Eventually, the lunch line returned to its silent procession. But a hard week passed before the new cashier learned who paid what.<br><br> The moment when I realized what my free lunches meant is still with me, and I can feel the heat in my face as I recount it. Though my family had no less money than the day before, that moment changed everything for me. I began to notice differences between myself and my classmates. Despite the fact that we all wore the same school uniform, the kids who paid for their lunches seemed to dress better. Was it the shoes? They even had better hair. Did they go to a salon instead of having it cut with a bowl and a pair of scissors at home? We had all grown up within a dozen miles of one another, but the free-lunch kids had our parents' Southern drawls. The lunch-money kids had the generic voices of newscasters, from everywhere and nowhere at once.<br><br> Always a shy kid, I became almost completely silent at school. Who was I to speak? Suddenly a new social ladder stretched out before me, above me. Its rungs were marked with shoes and hair and accents, telegraphing a code I was just learning to decipher. It did not matter that nothing in my circumstances had changed but my perspective. Now I was, in fact, poor.<br><br> If you are used to thinking about wealth and poverty purely in financial terms, the way an accountant would, my response makes no sense. My insight did not change my parents' income. It did not change our monthly expenses. It changed nothing in the world, except for me. But by redirecting my attention and altering my perceptions, my thoughts, and my actions, it changed my future.<br><br> To understand how we think about status, take a look at the image of the ladder on the next page. Imagine that the people at the top of this ladder are the best off. They have the most money, the best education, and the highest-paying jobs. The people at the bottom are the worst off. They have the least money, the lowest levels of education, and the most menial jobs, if they have jobs at all. If you were to assess your own economic position with respect to that of other people, which of the ten rungs would you place yourself on?<br><br> This simple image is one of the most widely used measures of subjective social status. Let's call it the Status Ladder. We should be able to perfectly predict where a person would place himself on the ladder if we knew his income, level of education, and the prestige of his job.<br><br> Except we can't-and we can't even come close to doing so. It is true that, on average, people with higher incomes, more education, and more prestigious jobs do rate themselves higher on the ladder. But the effect is relatively small. In a sample of, say, a thousand people, some will rate themselves at the top, others will rate themselves at the bottom, and many will be in between. But only about 20 percent of their self-evaluation is based on income, education, and job status.<br><br> This surprisingly small relationship between traditional markers of status and how it is perceived subjectively means that there are a lot of people who are by objective standards affluent and yet rate themselves on the lower rungs. Similarly, many people who are objectively poor rate themselves high up the ladder.<br><br> A standard economic analysis would argue that people's own conceptions of themselves are effectively airy nothings, mere noises that flit around like the sound of static between radio stations. If subjective perceptions do not align with objectively measurable quantities like money, then so much the worse for those perceptions. Certainly, money <i>is </i>part of the story, but it's not the whole story, and not even the main character.<br><br> We have to take subjective perceptions of status seriously, because they reveal so much about people's fates. If you place yourself on a lower rung, then you are more likely in the coming years to suffer from depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. The lower the rung you select, the more probable it is that you will make bad decisions and underperform at work. The lower the rung you select, the more likely you are to believe in the supernatural and in conspiracy theories. The lower the rung you select, the more prone you are to weight issues, diabetes, and heart problems. The lower the rung you select, the fewer years you have left to live.<br><br> Let me be clear that I am not simply asserting that, if you are poor, then all of these things are more likely to happen to you. I am stating, rather, that these things are more likely to happen to you if you <i>feel </i>poor, regardless of your actual income. Of course, one reason people might feel poor is that they are actually poor. But as we have seen, that's just 20 percent of the story. For the rest of it, we have to look at ordinary middle-class people and ask why it is that, regardless of actual money, so many of them feel that they are barely getting by, that they are living paycheck to paycheck, that the neighbors know something they don't, and that if they could just earn a little more, then everything would be a little bit better. To understand the Status Ladder, we have to look beyond bank accounts and start looking at people.<br><br> All of us are aware of how much money we make, but very few of us know whether we make enough. That's because the only way we determine how much is actually "enough" is by comparing ourselves to other people. We make comparisons to other people so habitually that we rarely even notice that we are doing so. When a neighbor pulls up in a new car, we don't typically say to ourselves, "They have an Audi, so I need one, too." We are more sophisticated and mature than that. We might tell ourselves that our neighbor's good fortune is none of our business, or that she deserves the new car because of her hard work. If we do have an immediate impulse to keep pace with her, we might banish the thought as soon as it appears. And yet, the next time we get in our own car, we notice just a little more than yesterday how worn the seat is getting. Social comparison is inevitable.<br><br> It is hard to recognize such comparisons at work in our own lives, because they take place in the background, and we are experiencing the foreground. When the noise in a restaurant gets louder, for example, we begin to feel that our dinner partner is speaking quietly, because our attention is on our partner's face, not the surrounding room.<br><br> While we feel rich or poor based on the comparisons we make, the fact that social comparisons always take place in the background causes certain blind spots. Think for a minute about what matters most to you. What are the values that make you who you are? What are the motives that drive you? I have asked hundreds of people these questions over the years, and the usual responses include such ideals as love, faith, loyalty, honesty, and integrity. Although there is some variety in the answers, the whole list could be written on a business card. They are similar for men and for women, for Northerners and for Southerners, for Democrats and for Republicans. And yet, no one ever mentions something that we know to be true, both from scientific studies and from simply being human: "I crave status."<br><br> Others might not acknowledge that, but we can certainly see it in their behavior. We can observe it in the clothes they buy, in the houses they choose to live in, and in the gifts they give. Above all we can perceive it in the constantly shifting standards for what counts as "enough." If you have ever received a raise, only to adapt to the new level of income in a few months and again begin to feel as though you were still living paycheck to paycheck as before, then you can experience it in yourself. As your accomplishments rise, so do your comparison standards. Unlike the rigid columns of numbers that make up a bank ledger, status is always a moving target, because it is defined by ongoing comparisons to others.<br><br> We make social comparisons to all sorts of people on every type of occasion, yet we mysteriously manage to find ourselves on the top half of the Status Ladder again and again. We find it most comfortable to reside there. Consider for a minute how accomplished you are at your job. How intelligent are you? How moral? How loyal a friend? Are you a good driver? Deep down, you know that you are better than the average person in all these respects. In fact, the majority of people know deep down that they are better than average at most things. Which, as far as anyone can tell, is not strictly possible.<br><br> This finding is called the Lake Wobegon effect, after Garrison Keillor's fictional town "where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average." The effect was stumbled upon in a 1965 study of accident survivors. Researchers spent six months interviewing all of the patients admitted to a Seattle hospital for injuries sustained in vehicle accidents. They compared the patients to a group of control participants who were matched on age, sex, race, and education. One of the interview questions asked the patients to rate their driving ability. Although it was not originally the main point of the study, that question is the reason that the study is remembered today, because the hospitalized patients rated themselves as better-than-average drivers. In fact, their ratings were just as high as those of the control group, who had not been in auto accidents. Clearly, these patients were not going to let the mere fact of being hospitalized after a car accident affect their self-image as good drivers.<br><br> Was it possible that the accidents were not, in fact, the patients' fault? For each case researchers examined police records to determine who was actually responsible and who was a blameless victim. After identifying those drivers who did cause the respective accidents, it was clear that their ratings were just as inflated as everyone else's.<br><br> Another early example of the effect was discovered in a massive survey by the College Board, which produces the SAT college entry exams. About a million students who took the SAT in a given year were asked to rate themselves compared with the median student (the median being the point at which half are better and half are worse). The ratings were not only about SAT performance, but also on personal characteristics like leadership and getting along with others. Seventy percent rated themselves as being above the median in leadership ability, and 85 percent rated themselves above the median in getting along well with others.<br><br> In another study, psychologist Constantine Sedikides and colleagues asked a group of volunteers to rate how good a person they were on several dimensions. The volunteers considered themselves to be more moral, kinder, more dependable, more trustworthy, and more honest than the average person-an unsurprising result, except that these volunteers were recruited by visiting a prison and enrolling convicted felons. The only category in which they did not consider themselves above average was "law abiding." Here, they rated themselves as average. Considering that they were behind bars at the time they made that judgment, it seems to lack a certain objectivity.<br><br> Over the years, hundreds of studies have replicated the Lake Wobegon effect. The studies show that most of us believe we are above average in intelligence, persistence, conscientiousness, badminton, and just about any other positive quality. The more we value the trait, the more we overrate ourselves with respect to it. My favorite study in this genre is one in which my fellow college professors were asked to rate their teaching abilities compared with those of their colleagues. A stunning 94 percent said they were better than average. One variant of this tendency is really the mother of all biases: Most people rate themselves as more objective and less biased than the average person.<br><br> Of course, pushing ourselves up the ladder in our own minds is not the only way we make the most of our social comparisons. Sometimes we pull other people down. I was recently standing in a supermarket checkout line and learned that Kim Kardashian was getting fat, Dolly Parton was wasting away, and Miley Cyrus was misusing her talent. Some housewives also seemed to be arguing with one another. Why is it that celebrity "news" showers us like confetti, but we never see headlines about Dale, the local HVAC repairman and his on-again, off-again relationship to Brenda, the home health care nurse?<br><br> The answer, of course, is that we are fascinated by high status. Since Aristotle, people of elevated status have served as the heroes in our dramas, because only someone who starts high up can fall from grace. In daily life, as in art, our eyes track the lives of the rich and famous and look right past the ordinary slouches to our left and right.<br><br> Why do we care so much about status? This is the point in most books where the argument is made that human beings are unique among the animal kingdom, but in this case the craving for status does not set us apart. In fact, it is such an ancient part of our nature that we share it with our primate cousins. Watching baboons or chimpanzees compete openly, physically, and sometimes violently for their position in the hierarchy feels simultaneously foreign and familiar to us. It's as uncomfortable as watching them mate: We feel embarrassed by their vulgarity and yet we recognize exactly what is driving them.</p><h2>They Call Me Assassin</h2><p>The hardest-hitting free safety in football reveals that, although he loves combat, he hates the injuries that result from his powerful charges, and he calls for changes in the game&#39;s rules to afford players better protection</p><p></p><h2>The Dinosaur Heresies: New Theories Unlocking the Mystery of the Dinosaurs and Their Extinction</h2><p>For over a century, dinosaurs have been thought of as plodding, dim-witted giant lizards too awkward and ill-equipped to survive the ravages of environmental change.

Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. In the nonmagic human world--the world of "Muggles"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. <p> A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, first published in England as <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, continues to win major awards in England. So far it has won the National Book Award, the Smarties Prize, the Children's Book Award, and is short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the U.K. version of the Newbery Medal.

You will begin to experience the fullness of a powerful, spiritual life, and you will find the perfect rest and peace of God Himself.</p><p><b>Andrew Murray</b> (1828&#x2013;1917) was an amazingly prolific Christian writer. He lived and ministered as both a pastor and author in the towns and villages of South Africa. Some of Murray&#x2019;s earliest works were written to provide nurture and guidance to Christians, whether young or old in the faith; they were actually an extension of his pastoral work. Once books such as <i>Abide in Christ, Divine Healing, </i>and<i> With Christ in the School of Prayer</i> were written, Murray became widely known, and new books from his pen were awaited with great eagerness throughout the world.<br> He wrote to give daily practical help to many of the people in his congregation who lived out in the farming communities and could come into town for church services only on rare occasions. As he wrote these books of instruction, Murray adopted the practice of placing many of his more devotional books into thirty-one separate readings to correspond with the days of the month.<br> At the age of seventy-eight, Murray resigned from the pastorate and devoted most of his time to his manuscripts. He continued to write profusely, moving from one book to the next with an intensity of purpose and a zeal that few men of God have ever equaled. He often said of himself, rather humorously, that he was like a hen about to hatch an egg; he was restless and unhappy until he got the burden of the message off his mind.<br> During these later years, after hearing of pocket-sized paperbacks, Andrew Murray immediately began to write books to be published in that fashion. He thought it was a splendid way to have the teachings of the Christian life at your fingertips, where they could be carried around and read at any time of the day.<br> One source has said of Andrew Murray that his prolific style possesses the strength and eloquence that are born of deep earnestness and a sense of the solemnity of the issues of the Christian life. Nearly every page reveals an intensity of purpose and appeal that stirs men to the depths of their souls. Murray moves the emotions, searches the conscience, and reveals the sins and shortcomings of many of us with a love and hope born out of an intimate knowledge of the mercy and faithfulness of God.<br> For Andrew Murray, prayer was considered our personal home base from which we live our Christian lives and extend ourselves to others. During his later years, the vital necessity of unceasing prayer in the spiritual life came to the forefront of his teachings. It was then that he revealed the secret treasures of his heart concerning a life of persistent and believing prayer.<br> Countless people the world over have hailed Andrew Murray as their spiritual father and given credit for much of their Christian growth to the influence of his priceless devotional books.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</h2><p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</p><p>As his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry approaches, 15-year-old Harry Potter is in full-blown adolescence, complete with regular outbursts of rage, a nearly debilitating crush, and the blooming of a powerful sense of rebellion. It's been yet another infuriating and boring summer with the despicable Dursleys, this time with minimal contact from our hero's non-Muggle friends from school. Harry is feeling especially edgy at the lack of news from the magic world, wondering when the freshly revived evil Lord Voldemort will strike. Returning to Hogwarts will be a relief... or will it?<p> The fifth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard, who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. Somehow, over the summer, gossip (usually traced back to the magic world's newspaper, the <i>Daily Prophet</i>) has turned Harry's tragic and heroic encounter with Voldemort at the Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teen. Even Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of the school, has come under scrutiny by the Ministry of Magic, which refuses to officially acknowledge the terrifying truth that Voldemort is back. Enter a particularly loathsome new character: the toadlike and simpering ("<i>hem, hem</i>") Dolores Umbridge, senior undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, who takes over the vacant position of Defense Against Dark Arts teacher--and in no time manages to become the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, as well. Life isn't getting any easier for Harry Potter. With an overwhelming course load as the fifth years prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations (O.W.Ls), devastating changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team lineup, vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors, and increasing pain in his lightning-shaped scar, Harry's resilience is sorely tested.</p><p> <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i>, more than any of the four previous novels in the series, is a coming-of-age story. Harry faces the thorny transition into adulthood, when adult heroes are revealed to be fallible, and matters that seemed black-and-white suddenly come out in shades of gray. Gone is the wide-eyed innocent, the whiz kid of <i>Sorcerer's Stone</i>. Here we have an adolescent who's sometimes sullen, often confused (especially about girls), and always self-questioning. Confronting death again, as well as a startling prophecy, Harry ends his year at Hogwarts exhausted and pensive. Readers, on the other hand, will be energized as they enter yet again the long waiting period for the next title in the marvelous, magical series.

Kaiser traces this dramatic change in our political system through the colorful story of Gerald S. J. Cassidy, one of Washington&#x2019;s most successful lobbyists. Superbly told, it&#x2019;s an illuminating dissection of a political system badly in need of reform.</p><p><b>Book Description</b><br> The startling story of the monumental growth of lobbying in Washington, D.C., and how it undermines effective government and pollutes our politics.<br> <p>A true insider, Robert G. Kaiser has monitored American politics for <i>The Washington Post</i> for nearly half a century. In this sometimes shocking and always riveting book, he explains how and why, over the last four decades, Washington became a dysfunctional capital. At the heart of his story is money--money made by special interests using campaign contributions and lobbyists to influence government decisions, and money demanded by congressional candidates to pay for their increasingly expensive campaigns, which can cost a staggering sum. In 1974, the average winning campaign for the Senate cost $437,000; by 2006, that number had grown to $7.92 million. The cost of winning House campaigns grew comparably: $56,500 in 1974, $1.3 million in 2006.</p> <p>Politicians&#x2019; need for money and the willingness, even eagerness, of special interests and lobbyists to provide it explain much of what has gone wrong in Washington. They have created a mutually beneficial, mutually reinforcing relationship between special interests and elected representatives, and they have created a new class in Washington, wealthy lobbyists whose careers often begin in public service. Kaiser shows us how behavior by public officials that was once considered corrupt or improper became commonplace, how special interests became the principal funders of elections, and how our biggest national problems--health care, global warming, and the looming crises of Medicare and Social Security, among others--have been ignored as a result.</p> <p>Kaiser illuminates this progression through the saga of Gerald S. J. Cassidy, a Jay Gatsby for modern Washington. Cassidy came to Washington in 1969 as an idealistic young lawyer determined to help feed the hungry. Over the course of thirty years, he built one of the city&#x2019;s largest and most profitable lobbying firms and accumulated a personal fortune of more than $100 million. Cassidy&#x2019;s story provides an unprecedented view of lobbying from within the belly of the beast.</p> <p>A timely and tremendously important book that finally explains how Washington really works today, and why it works so badly. </p> <br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: An Essay by Robert G. Kaiser</strong> <br><br> Last fall the House of Representatives set off a sudden collapse of the stock market by voting against the first version of the &#x201c;bailout&#x201d; legislation that had been hurriedly written to try to stabilize American banks and other financial institutions. Supporters of the bailout scrambled to change the legislation in ways that would win support for it from a majority of Congressmen. In a matter of days new provisions were added: extension of an excise-tax rebate for makers of Puerto Rican rum (cost to the Treasury, $192 million); extension of a special tax break for the owners of stock car racing tracks (cost, $100 million); a tax break for makers of movies within the borders of the United States (cost over ten years, $478 million) and more. These &#x201c;sweeteners&#x201d;--a revealing bit of Washington jargon--did the trick. Days after rejecting the $750 billion bailout, the House approved it. <br> <p>This dreary sequence was evidence of a fact that careful students of Washington&#x2019;s ways had realized for some time: In the first decade of the new millennium, the government of the United States was broken. It had taken three decades to create the mess. Democrats and Republicans had collaborated in its creation, and as that story of the sweetening of the bailout bill makes clear, money was at the heart of the problem.</p> <p>Those sweeteners were payoffs of a kind--spending proposals that would allow the politicians promoting them to boast of their own influence in Washington, hoping to win votes in the process. Spending on the favored projects of Senators and Congressmen had grown exponentially since Republicans took over congress in 1994 and decided that they could defend their majorities if their members could bring home a lot of bacon. Hence the explosion of the legislative provisions called &#x201c;earmarks&#x201d; that John McCain assailed in his presidential campaign. </p> <p>But money became a dominant factor in more insidious ways. Over the 30 years, opinion polls, focus groups and television commercials became the most effective tools to win elections, and all of them were expensive. So were the consultants whom candidates hired to make their commercials, shape their campaigns, even choose the issues they would run on. To win a politician needed a lot of money. Money could elect someone to office who never addressed important matters that affect ordinary Americans&#x2019; lives. Money elects candidates who have no real philosophy of governance nor a coherent view of the world. The result has been unreal politics--candidates winning or losing office on the basis of their positions on social issues essentially unrelated to governance, for example. </p> <p>Not addressing problems has become easy in a political environment distorted by money. In these three decades when money became so important in Washington, Congress lost much of its effectiveness as a governing institution. Running for reelection became more important than running the country, or keeping an eye on the exercise of executive power--the roles the Founders envisioned for the House and Senate. The quality of governance in the United States had declined palpably in these years.</p> <p> (Photo � Lucian Perkins) </p><b>Robert G.

By the author of The Story of the Night.</p><p>In the opening pages of <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i>, a stranger drives up to Helen O'Doherty's Dublin house to tell her that her brother Declan is in the hospital and needs to see her. At his request, she joins him at the creepy seaside house of their grandmother--where, as children, they awaited news of their dying father. What's more, they're not the only guests. Paul and Larry, friends of Declan who have known about his HIV diagnosis far longer than his family, are the next to arrive. And then comes Helen's estranged mother Lily, whom she hasn't seen in years. Still angry over the emotional abandonment she suffered during her youth, Helen had refused even to invite Lily to her wedding. Now she must come to terms not only with the imminent death of her beloved brother but also with her mother and grandmother--all at once.<p> Colm T�ib�n (<i>The Story of the Night</i>) delivers this unsentimental account of a troubled family in spare but suggestive language. He does allow his characters a few high-spirited remarks and the occasional outburst. Otherwise, though, he keeps his tone even, allowing for the perfect integration of a light, unforced symbolism. For Lily, broken hopes and dreams are bound up with the Blackwater Lightship, one of two lighthouses that once stood in the Irish Sea near Ballyconnigar. As a child, she believed that these would always be there: </p><blockquote> Tuskar was a man and the Blackwater Lightship was a woman and they were both sending signals to each other and to other lighthouses, like mating calls. He was forceful and strong and she was weaker but more constant, and sometimes she began to shine her light before darkness had really fallen. </blockquote> For Helen, on the other hand, it was the house itself that prompted her deepest, happiest fantasies. But now Lily has sold the property and shattered Helen's dream that "it would be her refuge, and that her mother, despite everything, would be there for her and would take her in and shelter her and protect her. She had never entertained this thought before; now, she knew that it was irrational and groundless, but nonetheless ... she knew that it was real and it explained everything." What Declan has done by drawing them all together at Granny's house is to enact this potent, poignant fantasy. Whether it has the power to reconstruct his family is another matter, but in any case, <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i> remains a gripping narrative, deftly delivered by a master storyteller. <i>--Regina Marler</i><b>Praise for <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i>:</b> <br> <br>&#x201c;This is a brilliant achievement.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Ottawa Citizen<br></i> <br>&#x201c;An exceptionally fine piece of writing.&#x2026;It&#x2019;s a measure of T�ib�n&#x2019;s craft that he can sustain his honest, steady gaze on the enigma of life.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Globe and Mail</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;This is the most astonishing piece of writing, lyrical in its emotion and spare in its <br>construction.&#x2026;T�ib�n has crafted an unmissable read.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Sunday Herald</i> (U.K.) <br> <br>&#x201c;A genuine work of art.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>Taiji Chin Na: The Seizing Art of Taijiquan (Chinese Internal Martial Arts)</h2><p><p>Chin Na is the art of seizing and controlling, and is an element of all Chinese martial arts including Taijiquan.</p><p>Today, most people practice Taijiquan to maintain health or cure sickness.

Dr Yang demonstrates a lot (and I mean a LOT) of grabbing, twisting, and throwing techniques personally, with copious photographs and explanations and attempts to explain the theory and concepts of grappling from within a taiji framework. For many taiji students, this is a wonderful insight into an aspect of their art that they may not have dreamed of. For non-taiji practitioners, this is still a good technical book to draw comparisons.

Consulting (www.holycowconsulting.com). Leading a church in the 21st century can be a bewildering experience as tried and true programs fail. Even ministry approaches that have proven fruitful in other church settings often yield disappointing results. Both leaders and members are left scratching their heads and wrestling with the feeling that they are missing something important. Consultant J. Russell Crabtree identifies this missing component and names it organizational intelligence. In spite of the fact that leaders and members may be immersed in the life of their church, they typically have little clarity regarding how people are experiencing the church overall, their hopes for the future, or the patterns of thinking and behavior, unique to their congregation, that must be addressed to realize their vision. Owls survive and thrive by seeing what other creatures do not see. The effective church in the 21st century will be one that invests in the kinds of information that are enabling other organizations to be effective in the world today. As churches move beyond simply counting attendance and dollars, and pay equal attention to the quality of the experience that members are offered, a whole new landscape opens that was previously invisible.</p><p></p><h2>Devils on the Deep Blue Sea: The Dreams, Schemes and Showdowns That Built America&#39;s Cruise-Ship Empires</h2><p>An exploration of America&#39;s cruise ship industry traces its meteoric rise throughout the past four decades, describing its humble beginnings in the early 1960s, the impact of the popular The Love Boat television series, and the influence of business practices and environmental laws. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>Kristoffer A. Garin is a journalist who has written for the New York Daily News and the Journal News in Westchester, New York.It's hard to imagine now, but when The Love Boat premiered in 1977, it was considered so sexually suggestive that Princess Cruises almost didn't allow the show to film on its ships because they were afraid it would give people the wrong image. Yet, in the long run, Garin points out, the series proved to be a critical factor in repositioning ocean cruises as an attractive luxury for middle-class consumers. Just a few years ago, Princess and three competitors accounted for almost 90 percent of the cruise industry's $13 billion annual revenues; when Princess began merger talks with Royal Caribbean, rival firm Carnival swooped in, made the deal themselves and wound up controlling more than half the market. Carnival's founder, the late Ted Arison, provides this lively industry history with one of its most engrossing narrative threads, from the running aground of his original flagship's maiden voyage to his emergence as one of the world's wealthiest individuals. But Garin's as interested in the ships themselves as he is in the boardrooms, and he turns up disturbing stories of corrupt labor practices and cover-ups of sexual assaults of passengers by crew members. The solid reporting ensures readers will come away with a healthy respect for Garin's work and for the very powerful industry he documents. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the 1980s Cartier granted Hans Nadelhoffer exclusive access to its archives in order to write the definitive history. Long out of print, Nadelhoffer&#39;s exhaustive research has been revived with lush new photography and design sketches of the world&#39;s most distinctive and finely crafted jewelry. Through charming and compelling anecdotes, these famed gemsand the elite clientele who don themare brought to life. This fully illustrated account is the essential complement to any jewelry lover&#39;s collection, and will satisfy the longings of all those who covet this legendary brand.</p><p>Rare BookCartier! The name still works its magic. But it was a long climb from the 1847 launch of Louis-Fran&amp;c184;ois Cartier's family business in the shadow of Paris's Eglise Saint-Eustache. The company's fortunes paralleled the rise of wealthy tycoons, rich on colony profits, and reached an early peak in the years before World War I. But it was under the three brothers Louis, Pierre and Jacques that Cartier became Cartier as we know it, the emblem <i>par excellence</i> of the Cocktail Age; one simply had to have that monogrammed tin-opener, that diamond belt, that gold toothpick. <p> Jewellery expert Hans Nadelhoffer was well placed to tell Cartier's glamorous story, first published in 1984 and now available for the first time in large, glossy paperback. Given the full run of the company's extensive archives, he tells the Cartier story, full of juicy anecdotes, and, importantly, brings to centre-stage Jeanne Toussaint, the woman whose taste became the litmus test for the Cartier brothers' creations, despite her complete lack of design skill: "My inability to draw qualifies me to assess the work of others". And for those who just want to drool at the pretty things, Nadelhoff drenches his narrative in nearly 500 illustrations, 200 of them in gorgeous Cartier technicolour.--<i>Alan Stewart</i></p></p><h2>The Diary of A Young Girl (Deluxe Hardbound Edition)</h2><p>One of the most famous accounts of living under the Nazi regime of World War II comes from the diary of a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl, Anne Frank.

His literary career began with Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827) but it was his deftly plotted short stories which attracted attention. He was also a noticeable literary critic and an unwearying reviewer and essayist. The recurring themes in his works the death of women, bereavement, horror, madness, premature burial, decay, revival of the dead, life after death are suggested to have resulted from his own life, which was a sequence of tragic events and frequent abandonments. Poe skillfully weaved these themes into his meticulous plots and created the macabre world of terror and dark romanticism bringing alive the horror through his choice of words. More than a century and a half after Poe s death, his works still remain as fresh and scary, sending a frightening chill down the spines of his readers.</p><h2>Expressive Portraits: Creative Methods for Painting People</h2><p><p><b>Paint beautiful and expressive portraits by combining watercolor with other mediums!</b></p><p>What makes an eye-popping, eye-stopping portrait?

On Friday, November 7, 1913, those gales captured their prey. After four days of winds up to 90 miles an hour, freezing temperatures, whiteout blizzard conditions, and mountainous seas, 19 ships had been lost, two dozen had been thrown ashore, 238 sailors were dead, and the city of Cleveland was confronting the worst natural disaster in its history. In White Hurricane, writer and mariner David G. Brown combines narrative intensity with factual depth to re-create the events of the &#34;perfect storm&#34; that struck America&#39;s heartland. Interweaving human drama, mystery, and historical consequence, Brown has created a vast epic ranging over Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie and echoing down the decades.</p><p>Great Lakes mariners fear the gales of November. Six to ten thousand vessels litter the lake bottoms, a disproportionate share--from LaSalle's <i>Le Griffon</i> in 1679 to the mighty <i>Edmund Fitzgerald</i> in 1975--lost in autumn storms. No one, however, was prepared for the killing wind that materialized from the unusually balmy days of early November 1913. On Friday, November 7, as hundreds of ships left port on their final trips of the season, a deadly atmospheric disturbance was already churning Lake Superior and spreading east. By Sunday night, Lake Huron was battered by winds up to 90 miles an hour, whiteout blizzard conditions, and mountainous 35-foot waves. The White Hurricane became the worst Great Lakes storm on record, the monstrous product of a meteorological chain of cause and effect that has yet to repeat itself. Twelve ships sank, and thirty-one more were stranded on rocks and beaches. At least 248 sailors lost their lives, and the city of Cleveland faced the worst natural disaster in its history. <p>In <i>White Hurricane</i>, nationally recognized nautical writer and experienced Great Lakes mariner David Brown re-creates the desperate struggles for survival aboard doomed and damaged vessels and on shore. Using first-hand accounts and contemporary newspaper reports, he reconstructs the progress of the storm in a tight chronology packed with vivid detail and unforgettable drama. He re-creates the long and desperate hours as captains blinded by driving snow tried to guess where treacherous shorelines lay; as layers of ice made ships top-heavy and threatened to capsize them; as rivets exploded like popcorn from hull plating; as sailors in one storm-tossed freighter watched a crack open up across their steel deck; and as the crew of another stood frozen in horror while a passing vessel broke up and sank before their eyes. And he does what the fledgling U.S. Weather Bureau of 1913 could not do: dissect the storm itself to highlight its hour-by-hour development. </p><p>The storm left mystery as well as devastation in its wake. Why, for instance, was the body of a crewman from the <i>Charles S. Price</i> found wearing a life jacket from another doomed ship, the <i>Regina</i>? Why did the <i>Henry B. Smith</i> set out into the Lake Superior blizzard with its hatches still open, never to be seen again? What turned the south end of Lake Huron into a killing zone Sunday night, and why were so many ships caught there? Brown follows all these strands deep into the heart of the storm, meeting the people who lived and died there, including the eighteen-year-old helmsman who may have saved the lives of his entire crew by disobeying his captain's order; the ship's engineer who was stirred by a premonition to quit his ship just before the season's final voyage, then met his shipmates again a few days later under far different circumstances; and the young captain who saw his crew into a lifeboat, then retired to his cabin to die. </p><p><i>White Hurricane</i> tells a big, multifaceted story that sprawls across nearly a thousand miles of storm-ravaged inland sea, combining a fast-paced narrative with scrupulous history and telling detail. </p><p><b>A Riveting Account of the 1913 Storm That Paralyzed the Heart of America</b> </p><p>"Ships in the grasp of the storm were on their own, beyond human aid. No matter what happened, they were cut off from potential rescue by the fierceness of the winds and the height of the waves. Even though their anchor held, <i>Regina</i>'s crew recognized their perilous situation. The pumps were no longer controlling the flooding, and their ship was becoming waterlogged. It would be only a matter of time before the small freighter succumbed to Lake Huron. Staying aboard a sinking ship was certain doom. If they were to survive, the crew realized they were going to have to rescue themselves."--from <i>White Hurricane</i></p><b>David G.

The Cone Collection not only contains major works from every phase of Matisse's long career but also reflects the sisters' special interest in his Nice period, when a new complexity of form and psychology entered the ever intense surface allure of his paintings. </p><p><em>Matisse in the Cone Collection</em> breaks new ground by offering the first scholarly exploration of this exceptional group of works, all donated to the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1950. Doreen Bolger's Foreword traces the Cone sisters' early association with Leo and Gertrude Stein, their growing friendship with Matisse, and the building of their collection. An essay by Jack Flam guides readers through the sisters' collection of Matisse's art and, simultaneously, charts the artist's development from his Neo-Impressionist work of the 1890s to his late style of the 1940s, which is marked by the use of cut-paper and an increasingly linear language of form. </p><p>The publication of this book will coincide with the reopening of the Cone Wing of the Baltimore Museum of Art after a renovation designed to make the galleries reflect the period in which the art was first made and collected.</p></p><p><p>Jack Flam is Distinguished Professor of Art and Art History at Brooklyn College and the Graduate School of the University of New York.

Then chance or fate intervened.<br> <br>Six months earlier, my first serious position after college as a translator-interpreter and small-projects manager in the Paris office of a Swedish company had ended abruptly when the office was closed during one of those periodic tough economic times that leads to downsizing. I had worked there more than a year and was given a bit of severance pay. Quite a bonanza for a girl in her twenties. And it got better.<br> <br>I needed a job, of course, and that led me to set my sights on the Council of Europe, which for young and innocent <i>moi</i> was the ultimate employer on my radar screen. I aced the qualifying exam and was offered a position as a translator starting the next session, in the fall. So, in the meantime, I used my severance pay to travel to America and Greece and on the spur of the moment took a last-minute discounted American Express weekend to Istanbul.<br> <br>On a bus from the airport to the hotel there, a handsome fellow with longish curly hair, blue eyes, and a deep tan said to me in French, <i>&#x201c;Vous �tes tr�s intelligente de voyager avec un p&#x2019;tit sac....&#x201d;</i> (You are very smart to travel so light).<br> <br>I always travel light, but in this case it was because I had left my suitcase back in Athens.<br> <br>I figured he was Turkish. He wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>He was an American from New York who had seen the same discounted trip from Athens to Istanbul.<br> <br>He became my companion for the next few days, and then for another few days back in Athens, and then for another few days, and then I was hopelessly in love.<br> <br>We wanted to continue our relationship, but he had to return to America, where he was completing his Ph.D. I went back to France. For the next weeks I faced what turned out to be the most important decision of my life. A classic: the job, the man, the city, the country?<br> <br>Familiar with it? The country, the city, the man, the job. The man or the job...the job or the man?<br> <br>Forget all my previous planning and dreaming, I chose the man and New York, my husband and home now for more than thirty years. I never took up my early dream of working at the Council of Europe.<br> <br>So much for planning, in business or in life. Lesson learned. Things happen. Opportunities are often unpredictable.<br> <br>Life is lived in episodes and stages. Episodes because they are roughly self-contained and somewhat arbitrary, at least as they relate to time and place. Stages because they evolve out of one another and are linear and in many cases inevitable, like adolescence or one&#x2019;s first professional position. Business, too, is lived in episodes and stages, and it has a sometimes cruel way of disarming our passions and shrugging off some of our most prized abilities as commonplace or irrelevant.<br> <br><b><b>PURSUING ONE&#x2019;S GIFTS</b></b><br> <br>One stage in my life began when I was a teenager in Eastern France and discovered a passion for languages&#x2014;my native French, increasingly important English, and old-world German, then the preeminent first language in Europe (though no one outside Germany wanted to admit it). When we are good at something&#x2014;and I was very good at the study of languages&#x2014;aren&#x2019;t we proud and motivated to pursue it and encouraged to do so by others? Sure. People who are good at music, dance, or athletics, for instance, fill their early years pursuing their gifts and pleasures, perhaps even becoming world-class performers or nearly so, and some even turn professional. But generally not for long.<br> <br>My interest in language and culture led me to become a high school exchange student outside Boston, then a college student in Paris, and eventually helped bring me to America to be with my soon-to-be husband, Edward, where I worked in the proverbial fields. Early on I was a translator, including for the UN, then, following my passion, I toiled in the lowest of the low positions at the New York office of Food and Wine from France. Then I moved on to a New York PR-advertising firm where I leveraged my French heritage and a bit of knowledge to become a director of the Champagne Bureau, a trade organization and U.S. division of the CIVC (Comit� Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne), promoting the entire Champagne industry. That&#x2019;s when&#x2014;college internships and entry-level jobs included&#x2014;I truly learned business and benefited from the fatherly teachings of the American owner of the agency.<br> <br>It seemed like a risk to me to take that first professional job in PR. As I&#x2019;ve noted, I had no training. I feared I would be unemployed in no time. Even sitting in my own office on Fifth Avenue with a secretary outside my door&#x2014;Fifth Avenue in New York City!&#x2014;gave me the willies at first. But then I discovered something about myself and about overcoming fears and anxieties.<br> <br>Maybe you, like me, can remember walking into your first real job or a new position after a promotion and wondering whether you could live up to your employer&#x2019;s expectations, whatever those were. For me, it turned out that some of my first tasks would involve public speaking and giving radio interviews, activities that rank right up there among people&#x2019;s most common dreads and anxieties. I&#x2019;d not connected being on the radio with the job before and had never imagined doing it. But my boss explained that I had an opportunity at hand and that handling the media was a responsibility that went with my new position.<br> <br>Champagne is the traditional drink of New Year&#x2019;s Eve, and a large percentage of annual consumption takes place from late November through January 1. Therefore, those are also the prime weeks for articles and interviews about Champagne. Over the years I have delivered the &#x201c;how to open a bottle&#x201d; talk countless times, usually during the last few days of December. Well, the first opportunity I ever had to give that little speech came my way just after I started this new job. I was told that I should pitch to radio stations the opportunity to conduct interviews about Champagne&#x2014;and then I was to be the one interviewed, mostly live!<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s say (<i>entre nous</i>) I was &#x201c;anxious&#x201d; over the charge. I can still remember my hand feeling weak as a I picked up the phone to call the first radio station and pitch them a story about Champagne. I needn&#x2019;t have worried, they wouldn&#x2019;t take my call anyway!<br> <br>I found dusty old pitch letters in the file. Now, I could have just blown off the cobwebs and sent those out to the same people who had been ignoring them since Prohibition was lifted. But I realized I had an advantage: I had an authentic French accent that people in New York frequently told me they found charming. I needed to have the chance to speak directly with someone who could actually make a decision. Just as a job application letter is designed to get you an interview, the pitch letter needs to be designed to get read and remembered&#x2014;and by the right person&#x2014;in order to secure you a spot. (And there are oral versions of pitch letters, too, that need to be polished for use on the phone or in person.) Also, I had to recognize that lots of pitches get tossed out unread (Don&#x2019;t we now do that constantly with emails?). So, first I called to get the name of the current booking manager. That proved to be extremely important. (Never misspell a name or send a letter to someone no longer in a position.) Then I recast the pitch letters to that person, always adding a little distinctive French phrasing at the beginning of the letter. Then the real work began. Knowing in advance that the success rate would not be high, I called and called stations across the country. Then I called some more.<br> <br>Sometimes people were busy or simply did not want to speak with me (part of the skill set for selling is the ability to accept rejection). Sometimes I got lucky, and people remembered me from the pitch letter. Sometimes I got very lucky and they called me after they got the pitch letter (obviously, in those cases my pitch aligned perfectly with helping them do their job and fill their slots). But mostly I called and called. When I did get through and spoke with a decision maker, including a preliminary one, I enjoyed remarkable success. &#x201c;Oh, is that a French accent?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s when I knew I had them and that I had a good voice for radio. We&#x2019;d talk over the phone about whatever they wanted&#x2014;from information about their trip to Paris or my recommendations for a French restaurant in New York. As we laughed and built a connection&#x2014;a key element in successful business&#x2014;interview after interview got scheduled. And with each interview that took place&#x2014;from sixty-second spots to sixty-minute programs with call-ins&#x2014;I not only overcame my fears but discovered that I enjoyed being interviewed and had a talent for it. I learned the importance of doing more than is expected and that there are lots of good ideas in business, but execution is what matters. And you can be most effective when you align your special talents to the task at hand. (What is it that you have your predecessors didn&#x2019;t or your colleagues don&#x2019;t? Perhaps just a better work ethic or simply a distinctive and attractive accent.) Plus there are new approaches to good, old ideas, like the ones I managed to find with the pitch letters. To the astonishment of my boss, I did fifty-three interviews that first season, compared with three the previous one. It was a year&#x2019;s worth of results in a few weeks, and it built my business confidence enormously. And it helped build a stage in my life and career. <i>C&#x2019;�tait le bon temps.</i><br> <br>I could still be doing that today&#x2014;promoting Champagne across America&#x2014;what a great job. I progressed quickly to the head of the line to take over the PR firm with its various accounts when the owner retired, but instead I took a chance and moved down one of those roads less traveled, and it made all the difference. So, life and careers are lived in episodes and stages, but taking some calculated chances (read: risks) also makes all the difference. And you cannot always time your opportunities. Controlling one&#x2019;s fears and anxieties by not letting them dictate premature decisions is part of a solid professional skill set. And especially in tough economic times, fear has the tendency to try to pull us by the nose, something that&#x2019;s hard to fight, but being aware of it helps.<br> <br><b>STARTING OUT WITHOUT <i>PISTON</i></b><br> <br>Gaining my career-launching position at the Champagne Bureau in New York was a combination of luck and skill. Certainly it was a case of being in the right place at the right time. But it did not come through any networking or connections. In France and elsewhere, having some &#x201c;pull&#x201d; often gets you that first or second job. In French it is called <i>piston,</i> and I did not have any...something I was painfully aware of when I walked the streets of Paris and then New York searching for a suitable position. No father or uncle, sister or brother to make a call to a colleague for me. In America, meritocracy, college placement offices, and sometimes a mentoring professor-advisor play a larger role than in Europe in helping one get started professionally. Not that networking and some personal pull are not useful, especially as one advances, but in America you can get an interview largely on your own.<br> <br>In France, it is still much more of a club atmosphere, and I cannot tell you the number of times I&#x2019;ve been asked by someone in France to help a friend or colleague&#x2019;s son or daughter, niece or nephew to get a job or internship in New York. I generally do everything I can to help, remembering what it was like to be young and full of dreams as well as confusion and sometimes even hopelessness at that stage in life. I did not always like it when the young aspirant was connected to a top LVMH executive, because then the cultural expectation was that you&#x2019;d create a position if you did not already have one with his or her name divinely affixed to it, yet that is the way of the world. Still, it is easy to understand parents and relatives who want to do everything they can to help their family members.<br> <br>I was reminded of how tough it can be to get ahead without a little coaching and <i>piston</i> when I met Maria, a European in her late twenties, who was stuck in her entry-level position, living in a faded third-tier European city, and desperate to move to a new stage in life. (Remember that just because you are stuck in a stage now does not mean you cannot move out of it...preferably sooner, but it might have to be later.) Her world reminded me of the old European style and customs that I had known but had become distanced from while living in the electricity and culture of New York.<br> <br><b><b>MARIA&#x2019;S NEXT STAGE</b></b><br> <br>Maria is a tall, attractive woman gifted in both science and languages. A top student, she earned a master&#x2019;s degree in biology and took a job at a not-for-profit cancer research center in a small city an hour and a half from where her parents live. And there she stayed in a poorly paid job for two, three, four years, and then into a fifth year. She was more than poised for the next stage in her personal and professional life, but she could not see her way out. Her boss was awful, her work no longer a challenge, and she was chained to her cubicle, so she had little opportunity to explore jobs in another city. Plus, she had no money, less than no money. She had to count on help from her parents, who have modest means, to help her live extremely modestly. Not a pretty picture or rosy future. I am sure many people know or can relate to someone like Maria.<br> <br>Our paths crossed when she was doing some freelance writing on health and nutrition and I was impressed by her knowledge and eventually by her personality, not to mention her ability to communicate in German, English, French, Italian, and Spanish. &#x201c;I was so bored at work and at nights, I would listen to and sing songs in those languages and read news and articles on the Internet to learn and improve my languages,&#x201d; she explained to me, as if it were nothing.<br> <br>I met her in person for the first time in New York when a publishing company paid for her to come on the cheap for two days for a job interview. She was incredibly excited by this singular opportunity, but was quickly devastated with disappointment when a visa snafu shot down her dreams.<br> <br>The episode and her situation moved me, so I told her to be patient and that I&#x2019;d try to help her. I knew I could do that eventually but did not want to give her false hopes of a magic-wand solution. I invited her to spend some time with us in France, where I got to know her better and probed to find out what she really wanted to do. She started out saying she&#x2019;d do anything, she was so desperate to get out of her job and city, where being single and young was a signal to get married or move.<br> <br>Through many discussions of her likes, dislikes, passions and fears, talents, skills, and dreams, we narrowed down the realistic possibilities, starting with the fact that the job should be in Europe, where she could work with proper papers and also not be too far from her family.

But no one close to Liston believed that his death was acci�dental. Digging deep into a life that Liston tried hard to hide, investigative journalist Shaun Assael treats the boxer&#x2019;s death as a cold case. The result is a page-turning who�dunit that evokes a glorious and grimy era of Las Vegas. <br> &nbsp;<br> Elvis Presley was playing two shows a night at the International. Howard Hughes was running his empire from the penthouse suite of the Desert Inn. And middle America was flocking to the Strip, transforming it from an exclusive playground for the mob to a mecca for corporate dollars. But the city was also rotting from within. Heroin was pouring over the border from Mexico, and the segregated Westside was on the cusp of a race war. The cops, brutally violent, were barely holding it together. <br> &nbsp;<br> Driving through town with the top of his pink Cadillac down, Sonny Liston was the one celebrity who was unafraid to bridge the two sides of Las Vegas. Cashing in on his fading notoriety in the casinos, he was dealing drugs, working for a crime syndicate, and trying to break into Hollywood&#x2014;all with a boxer&#x2019;s faith that he could duck any threat, slip any punch. Heroin addiction was the only knockout blow he didn&#x2019;t see coming. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Murder of Sonny Liston </i>takes a fresh look at the legendary boxer, the town he called home, and one of America&#x2019;s most enduring mysteries.</p><p>Shaun Assael, who has been with ESPN The Magazine since its launch in 1998, is a member of ESPN's investigations unit and a regular contributor to the show <i>Outside the Lines</i>. &nbsp;He is also the author of three books: <i>Wide Open: Days and Nights on the NASCAR Tour</i>; <i>Sex, Lies, and Headlocks</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> best seller; and <i>Steroid Nation</i>, a definitive account of the steroid era.***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected copy proof*** <br><br>Copyright � 2016 Shaun Assael<br><br><p>INTRODUCTION<br>On January 9, 1971, Geraldine Liston watched an over- flow crowd at the Palm Mortuary pass by her husband&#x2019;s steel casket. The crowd comprised the business end of Las Vegas: showgirls, card dealers, casino execs, mob associates. Geraldine, her brown eyes hooded but sharp, studied their faces.</p><p>Some were there for the show. Stan Armstrong, a documentary filmmaker, would recall walking a mile from his house at the age of fourteen because he knew the funeral of Sonny Liston would be a piece of history. Others were there simply to be seen. Ed Sullivan, Ella Fitzgerald, and Doris Day sat in the front row and sang mournfully as the Ink Spots did a special rendition of the 1966 hit &#x201c;Sunny.&#x201d;</p><p>The last time Geraldine saw her husband alive, she was rushing to the airport to take their adopted son, Daniel, on a family visit to St. Louis. Even closing on fifty, Sonny still looked like he was meant for only one thing. He was built like a mushroom cloud with coal eyes that had dead reckoning in them and monstrous hands that punched with the force of a government crash test.</p><p>When she returned home from her trip, Geraldine expected to find her husband planning his next fight or maybe playing craps with his best friend, Joe Louis. Instead, she followed the smell of rotting flesh to her bedroom, where she found his corpse slumped backward over their bed. So much methane was escaping up his legs that his penis was fully engorged and his testicles were the size of pool balls.</p><p>There was an era when Sonny terrified God-fearing whites by carrying the mantle of the angriest black man in America. But that time was long gone. Since the Beatles put him on the cover of Sgt. Pepper and the Monkees put him in a movie, he&#x2019;d receded into a kind of genteel notoriety. Around Vegas, the restaurants comped him, the hookers waved as he passed by, and cops offered him rides home when he was drunk. He returned the favor by handing out preprinted business cards with his sig- nature to tourists.</p><p>During his time in the spotlight, Sonny made it perfectly clear that he was willing to cheat on Geraldine whenever he had the chance. When a waitress presented them with a child that Sonny had fathered a few years before, Geraldine adopted the boy as her own, hoping he might finally give her the family she always wanted. Sonny never became an ideal father, but his frag- ile fidelity always did lead him back home to her. And for that Geraldine remained his biggest defender. &#x201c;He acts like he loves me, whether he does or not,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He takes care of his home and that&#x2019;s all you can ask of a man.&#x201d;</p><p>On the night she found him, Geraldine let the police who were called to investigate do their work without helping too much. They walked past the stuffed bear in the living room that had Sonny&#x2019;s title belt wrapped around it and into the den where he kept his prized photos: the framed portrait with his arm around Lyndon Johnson; the one of him laughing it up with Sammy Davis Jr.; the sepia-toned keepsake of him mugging with Louis when he first took the crown from Floyd Patterson in 1962. They rubbernecked, taking photos of themselves in front of the photos.</p><p>For all of its sophistication, Las Vegas was an unforgiving place in the early 1960s and it took a mean and unapologetic police force to hold it together. At the Greyhound station, plain- clothes officers kept their eyes on the two-bit con men who rode in from wherever their last bit of luck had run out. As one dep- uty would say, &#x201c;We had a blue binder book that had pictures of all the known career criminals. The sheriff used to tell us, &#x2018;If you kick their ass enough or throw them in jail enough, they&#x2019;ll leave town.&#x2019; So whenever we saw somebody in that book, we found a way to kick their ass.&#x201d;</p><p>The town was deeply segregated, too. &#x201c;If you were black and walking down the Strip just looking at the buildings and taking pictures, the sheriff &#x2019;s department would take you to jail,&#x201d; recalls Wilbur Jackson, one of the first African-American cops in the city when he was hired in 1958. &#x201c;On the booking sheet, they&#x2019;d write NOS.&#x201d; It stood for Nigger on the Strip.</p><p>In response, the residents of the Westside built their own shadow Strip along Jackson Street and filled it with rollicking jazz and bebop joints. But by 1970, Jackson Street had become a tapped-out vein running through the redlined heart of a ghetto. Riots and civic neglect transformed the area into a badland where few without business dared to go. Sonny, of course, feared no one, and consequently made the Westside&#x2019;s best-known lounge, the Town Tavern, his home away from home.</p><p>On Christmas Day 1970, Sonny walked into the tavern with a white showgirl on each arm and ran into Clyde &#x201c;Rabbit&#x201d; Watkins, a former pool hustler who worked as a bellman at Caesars Palace. Watkins had met Sonny when he moved to town in 1966 and quickly became part of his entourage, jumping into Sonny&#x2019;s pink Cadillac when he wanted company and keeping an eye out when strangers started to get on the big man&#x2019;s nerves.<br>Watkins tipped the brim of his hat and wished his friend a Merry Christmas.</p><p>&#x201c;What you doing later?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Coming to your house to eat,&#x201d; Sonny answered, laying his huge hands on Watkins&#x2019;s back.</p><p>To Watkins and all who saw Sonny that day, the champ was still a force of nature. Eight Christmases before, he had posed for the cover of Esquire in a red Santa Claus cap, looking every bit like an overgrown prison elf ready to shiv a reindeer. And as far as Watkins was concerned, little had changed. He remained a menacing slab of manhood. Immutable. Impervious. Impossible. As a writer for Sports Illustrated once observed, &#x201c;If [a] ship were going down, I would look at Sonny Liston to tell me what to do.&#x201d; So Watkins was shocked when he was working the night shift at Caesars and heard that the police were reporting that Sonny was dead. He grabbed Joe Louis and Sonny&#x2019;s former manager, Ash Resnick, both of whom were on the casino floor, and ran red lights until they reached 2058 Ottawa Drive.</p><p>Geraldine was not happy to see Watkins. She wasn&#x2019;t blind to what her husband did, but she was old-fashioned enough to think that whatever it was should stay on the other side of town. Nor was she thrilled to see Resnick. He&#x2019;d guided Sonny through his first fight against Muhammad Ali and it turned out to be the costliest loss of his career. Resnick was a player, and as far as Geraldine was concerned, Resnick had played them out of their retirement.</p><p>But what could she say about Louis? Joe had always been generous to Sonny and was probably his best friend in Las Vegas. The problem was he&#x2019;d also just been treated in a psychiatric hospital for a heroin addiction that made him delusional. They were a triangle without a steady side.</p><p>They also entered just in time to watch two medical examiners struggling to load Sonny into a body bag. He was just six- foot-one but he was thick, and the rigor mortis made him hard to lift. The coroners got him as far as the stairs when one of them slipped and sent the corpse sliding. It landed on the living room floor with a thud.</p><p>The Three Amigos stood over the body, slightly stunned. And as the house filled with cops, the last thing they needed to do was answer questions, especially after a sheriff&#x2019;s sergeant found a balloon of heroin on the kitchen table, below a wall phone. So they left.</p><p>The discovery of heroin led to a flurry of queries for Geraldine. What did she know about the drugs? Why had she waited three hours after walking through the door to report his death? What exactly did she find when she first got home? Was there any evidence of a struggle?</p><p>She waved off the questions, making it clear that she had nothing more to add that night. &#x201c;Due to Mrs. Liston&#x2019;s apparent shock over the death of her husband,&#x201d; one officer wrote, &#x201c;we were unable to interview her for further information.&#x201d; </p><p>She would keep whatever suspicions she had to herself until her death.<br>As Sonny&#x2019;s funeral wore on, Geraldine was consumed not only by who showed up but by who didn&#x2019;t. Her husband kept a large swath of his life a secret, and the people he kept in the shadows weren&#x2019;t about to show their faces now.</p><p>That included a well-known trumpeter who ran a drug gang and had hired Sonny to do collections for him with a .38 strapped to his ankle. The bandleader had a long track record with the cops and knew that they liked him for some part of Sonny&#x2019;s death, even if they didn&#x2019;t know what part yet.</p><p>And there was the beautician who dealt drugs out of the hair salon he ran across the tracks. He and Sonny did business together before they had a falling-out. Word on the street was that the beautician was looking for a piece of Sonny&#x2019;s scalp.</p><p>Even stranger was a milky alliance between a hero cop and an alcoholic grifter who became enmeshed in the darkest secret of Sonny&#x2019;s career: the circumstances of his first-round surrender to Muhammad Ali in 1965.</p><p>The Nation of Islam, meanwhile, lurked in the shadows, as worrisome an influence as it had been during that fight when rumors surfaced that its founder threatened to assassinate Sonny if he didn&#x2019;t take a dive. Ali was preparing to fight Joe Frazier for the biggest paycheck in the history of the sport, and Sonny was making noises that Ali owed him a piece of that purse as payment for taking a dive in &#x2019;65, although that seemed to be news to Ali. The Nation&#x2019;s leaders had as much reason as anyone to make sure Sonny kept his mouth shut.</p><p>These were powerful people with means and connections, and they had all worried that Sonny was spiraling out of control. In her own way, Geraldine pleaded with him to slow down, enjoy life, and focus on raising their adopted son, who was all of seven. But whether it was because he was facing a midlife crisis or he simply thought no one could hurt him, Sonny couldn&#x2019;t take his foot off the gas. He&#x2019;d always had a girl or four on the side, but he was risking more than usual this time around. He&#x2019;d fallen in love with a buxom cocktail waitress who&#x2019;d turned him on to heroin.</p><p>In what might have been the biggest threat of all, the feds were beginning to look into the source of the drugs he was buying and selling. An undercover agent had already met with him about doing a drug deal and there was every indication that Sonny was going to fall for the trap. There was no telling what he would do if he had to start wearing a wire on his friends. But it was hard to imagine anyone in Las Vegas who had a larger or more varied group of people who already wished him ill.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why those close to Sonny were skeptical when the coroner of Clark County issued a report that attributed his death to natural causes&#x2014;specifically fluid on the lungs. It wasn&#x2019;t an un- common way for a man of roughly fifty to die, especially since the underlying cause was ruled to be a lack of blood flow to the heart, a common affliction for people with hardened arteries. But Sonny was no ordinary man. As recently as his last fight in June of 1970, his body looked fifteen years younger than his face, still massive and muscular. Nine of his fifty-four fights ended in the first round and twenty-five others failed to go halfway.</p><p>&#x201c;I knew the mortician who took care of Sonny,&#x201d; Rabbit Watkins would say in his Las Vegas home, not far from the Town Tavern, when I tracked him down more than forty years later. &#x201c;He told me, from what he seen, that wasn&#x2019;t no natural causes.&#x201d; The death of Sonny Liston remains one of the most enduring mysteries in Las Vegas. There never was a homicide investigation because his death was never classified as a homicide. As a result, leads surfaced that haven&#x2019;t been followed, suspects died with their secrets, and stories haven&#x2019;t been told.</p><p>At the funeral, Geraldine flung herself at her husband&#x2019;s casket and yelled, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even see his face. Oh Jesus.&#x201d; Then she rose and shouted a question that would hover over the case for the next five decades. &#x201c;Can you tell me what happened to you, Sonny?&#x201d;</p></p><h2>A Dangerous Plan (Left Behind: The Kids, Book 20)</h2><p>With over eight million copies sold in the series, Left Behind: The Kids is a favorite of kids aged 10-14.

She lives in North London.</p>ON E<br> eee<br> &nbsp;<br> The Truth will set you free.<br> Swami Pur na<br><br>Muriel Donnelly, an old girl in her seventies, was left in a hospi- tal cubicle for forty-eight hours. She had taken a tumble in Peck- ham&nbsp; High&nbsp; Street&nbsp; and&nbsp; was&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; with&nbsp; cuts,&nbsp; bruises&nbsp; and<br>suspected concussion. Two days she lay in A &amp; E, untended, the blood stiffening on her clothes.<br>It made the headlines. TWO&nbsp; DAYS! screamed the tabloids. Two days on a trolley, old, neglected, alone. St. Jude&#x2019;s was be- sieged by reporters, waylaying nurses and shouting into their mo- biles, didn&#x2019;t they know the things were forbidden? Photos showed her lolling gray head and black eye. Plucky pensioner, she had survived the Blitz for this? Her image was beamed around&nbsp; the country:&nbsp; Muriel&nbsp; Donnelly,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latest&nbsp; victim of&nbsp; the&nbsp; collapsing NHS, the latest shocking statistic showing that the British health system, once the best in the world, was disintegrating in a welter of underfunding, staff shortages and collapsing morale.<br>A hand-wringing&nbsp; why-oh-why&nbsp; piece appeared&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Daily Mail, an internal investigation was ordered. Dr. Ravi Kapoor was interviewed. He was weary but polite. He said Mrs. Donnelly had received the appropriate&nbsp; care and that she was waiting for a bed. He didn&#x2019;t mention that he would kill for an hour&#x2019;s sleep. He didn&#x2019;t mention that since the closure of the Casualty department at the neighboring hospital, his own, at St. Jude&#x2019;s, had to cope with twice the number of drunks, drug overdoses and victims of pointless violence; that St. Jude&#x2019;s would soon be closing because its site, in the center of Lewisham, was deemed too valuable for sick people; that the private consortium&nbsp; that had taken it over had sold the land to Safeway, who were planning to build a super- store.<br>Exhausted, Ravi drove home to Dulwich. Walking up his path, he paused to breathe deeply. It was seven in the evening; some- where a bird sang. Beside the path, daffodil blooms had shriveled into tissue paper. Spring had come and gone without his noticing.<br>In the kitchen, Pauline was reading the Evening Standard. The story had gathered momentum;&nbsp; other cases were printed,&nbsp; out- raged relatives told their tales.<br>Ravi opened a carton of apple juice. &#x201c;Thing is, I didn&#x2019;t men- tion the real reason the old bat wasn&#x2019;t treated.&#x201d;<br>Pauline fetched him a glass. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She wouldn&#x2019;t let any darkies touch her.&#x201d;<br>Pauline burst&nbsp; out&nbsp; laughing.&nbsp; At another&nbsp; time&#x2014;another&nbsp; life- time, it seemed&#x2014;Ravi would have laughed too. Nowadays&nbsp; that place was unreachable, a golden land where, refreshed and rested, he could have the energy to find things funny.<br>Upstairs the lavatory flushed.<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Ravi&#x2019;s head reared up. There was a silence.<br><br>&#x201c;I was going to tell you,&#x201d; said Pauline. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;<br>Footsteps creaked overhead.<br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t be here for long, honestly, not this time,&#x201d; she bab- bled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told him he&#x2019;s got to behave himself&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;<br>He knew, of course.<br>Pauline looked at him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my father.&#x201d;<br>Ravi was a man of compassion. He was a doctor; he tended the sick, he mended the broken. Those who were felled by accident, violence or even self-mutilation found in him a grave and reassuring presence. He bandaged up the wounds of those who lay at the wayside, unloved and unlovable; he staunched the bleeding. No- body was turned away, ever. To do the job, of course, required detachment. He had long ago learned a sort of numbed empathy. Bodies were problems to be solved. To heal them he had to vio- late them by invading their privacy, delving into them with his skilled fingers. These people were frightened. They were utterly alone, for sickness is the loneliest place on earth.<br>Work sealed him from the world that delivered him its casual- ties, the doors sighing open and surrendering them up to him; he was suspended from the life to which he would return at the end of his shift. Once home, however, he showered off the hospital smell and became a normal person. Volatile, fastidious, a lover of choral music and computer games, sympathetic enough but somewhat&nbsp; drained.&nbsp; Of&nbsp; course he was compassionate,&nbsp; but&nbsp; no more or less than anybody else. After all, the Hippocratic&nbsp; Oath need not apply on home territory. And especially not to a disgust- ing old sod like Norman.<br>Barely a week had passed and already Ravi wanted to murder his father-in-law. Norman was a retired structural engineer, a monumental&nbsp; bore and a man of repulsive habits. He had been thrown out of his latest residential home for putting his hand up a nurse&#x2019;s skirt. &#x201c;Inappropriate sexual behavior,&#x201d;&nbsp; they called it, though Ravi could not imagine what appropriate&nbsp; behavior could possibly be, where Norman&nbsp; was concerned. His amorous anec- dotes, like a loop of Muzak, reappeared with monotonous regu- larity. Already Ravi had heard, twice this week, the one about catching the clap in Bulawayo. Being a doctor, Ravi was treated to Norman&#x2019;s more risqu� reminiscences in a hoarse whisper.<br>&#x201c;Get me some Viagra, old pal,&#x201d; he said, when Pauline was out of the room. &#x201c;Bet you&#x2019;ve got some upstairs.&#x201d;<br>The man cut his toenails in the lounge! Horrible&nbsp; yellowing shards of rock. Ravi had never liked him, and age had deepened this into loathing of the old goat with his phony regimental tie and stained trousers. Ruthlessly selfish, Norman&nbsp; had neglected his daughter&nbsp; all her life; ten years earlier, however, pancreatic cancer had put his long-suffering wife out of her misery and he had battened on to Pauline. Once, on safari in Kenya, Ravi had watched&nbsp; a warthog&nbsp; muscling its way to a water&nbsp; hole, barging aside any animal that got in its way. He retained, for some rea- son, a vivid image of its mud-caked arse.<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand much more of this,&#x201d; he hissed. Nowadays&nbsp; he and Pauline had to whisper like children. Despite his general di- lapidation, Norman&#x2019;s hearing was surprisingly sharp.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing my best, Ravi, I&#x2019;m seeing another place tomorrow, but it&#x2019;s difficult to find anywhere else to take him. Word gets around, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we just send him away somewhere?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, but where?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Somewhere far, far away?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ravi, that&#x2019;s not nice. He is my father.&#x201d;<br><br>Ravi looked at his wife. She changed when her father&nbsp; was around. She became more docile, in fact goody-goody, the dutiful daughter&nbsp; anxious&nbsp; that&nbsp; the two&nbsp; men in her life get along. She laughed shrilly at her father&#x2019;s terrible jokes, willing Ravi to join in. There was a glazed artificiality to her.<br>Worse still, with her father in the house he noticed the similar- ity between them. Pauline had her father&#x2019;s square, heavy jaw and small eyes. On him they looked porcine, but one could still see the resemblance.<br>Norman&nbsp; had stayed with them several times during the past year&#x2014;whenever he was kicked out of a residential home, in fact. The stays were lengthening as establishments that hadn&#x2019;t heard of him became harder to find. &#x201c;The man&#x2019;s a menace,&#x201d; said the manager of the last one, &#x201c;straight out of&nbsp; Benny Hill. We lost a lovely girl from Nova Scotia.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thing is, he&#x2019;s frightened of women,&#x201d; said Ravi. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why he has to jump them all the time.&#x201d;<br>Pauline looked at him. &#x201c;At least someone does.&#x201d;<br>There was a silence. They were preparing Sunday lunch. Ravi yanked open the oven door and pulled out the roasting tin.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so tired,&#x201d; he said.<br>It was true. He was always exhausted. He needed time to re- vive himself, to restore himself. He needed a good night&#x2019;s sleep. He needed to lie on the sofa and listen to Mozart&#x2019;s Requiem. Only then could he become a husband again&#x2014;a human being, even. The house was so small, with her father in it. Ravi&#x2019;s body was in a permanent&nbsp; state of tension. Every room he went into, Norman&nbsp; was there. Just at the Lacrimosa he would blunder in, the transistor&nbsp; hanging on a string around&nbsp; his neck burbling the cricket commentary from Sri Lanka.<br>&#x201c;He uses my computer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t change the subject,&#x201d; said Pauline.<br><br>The place stank of Norman&#x2019;s cigarettes. When they banished him outside, the patio became littered with butts like the Out- patients doorway at St. Jude&#x2019;s.<br>&#x201c;He downloads pornographic sites.&#x201d; When Ravi entered his study the chair was skewed from the desk; the room felt violated. Fag-ends lay drowned in the saucer underneath&nbsp; his maidenhair fern.<br>Pauline slit open a packet of beans. They both knew what they were talking about.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; Ravi stroked her hair. &#x201c;I want to, really. It&#x2019;s just, the walls are so thin.&#x201d;<br>It was true. At night, when they lay in bed, Ravi could almost feel her father a few inches away, lying in the pigsty that had once been the spare bedroom.<br>&#x201c;But he&#x2019;s asleep,&#x201d; said Pauline.<br>&#x201c;Yes, I can hear that, all too distinctly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He is amazing,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never known anybody who can snore and fart at the same time.&#x201d;<br>Ravi laughed. Suddenly they were conspirators.&nbsp; Pauline put the beans on the counter and turned to her husband. Ravi put his arms around her and kissed her&#x2014;truly kissed her, the first time in weeks. Her mouth&nbsp; opened against his; her tongue, pressing against his own, gave him an electric jolt.<br>He pushed his wife against the kitchen unit. She was hot from cooking. He thrust his hand down her slippery cleavage, down beneath her blouse and her stiff butcher&#x2019;s apron. He felt her nip- ple; her legs buckled.<br>&#x201c;Sweetheart,&#x201d; he said. She moved her body against his. He slid his hand into the small of her back to cushion her from the cup- board knobs.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go upstairs,&#x201d; she whispered.<br>There was a sound. They swung round. Norman came in, zip- ping up his trousers.<br><br>&#x201c;Just had the most monumental dump. Must be those chick- peas last night.&#x201d; Norman&nbsp; rubbed his hands. &#x201c;Something smells good.&#x201d;<br>Norman Purse was a vigorous man. Never any problem in that department. His work, building bridges, had taken him all over&#x2014; Malaysia,&nbsp; Nigeria.&nbsp; He had sampled the fleshpots of Bangkok and Ibadan and was proud of his linguistic fluency; in six African languages he could say &#x201c;Show me your pussy.&#x201d; Oh yes, he had plenty of lead in his pencil.<br>His wife, Rosemary, hadn&#x2019;t put up a fuss. She had been a pretty girl once, nicely turned ankles, a bloom to her. That was the trou- ble: she was too bloody nice. There were certain things a chap couldn&#x2019;t do with a well-bred English rose. Besides, she was his wife. After a few years, like all roses, she was past her best. She had grown into a mousy, middle-aged person who cooked his meals and scuttled around doing whatever women did, hardly a peep from her. To be perfectly honest, the woman wasn&#x2019;t a barrel of laughs. The only time he heard her giggle was behind closed doors with their daughter Pauline. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so funny?&#x201d; he would ask, opening the door. They would jump like rabbits. Then, when he went&nbsp; away,&nbsp; they&nbsp; would&nbsp; start&nbsp; all over again.&nbsp; Women&nbsp; were strange creatures.<br>And now Rosemary was long since dead and his own daughter had become a middle-aged matron herself. Pushing fifty, if he remembered it right. One of these career girls, travel agent, never seen her way to give him a grandchild. But a damn good cook, like her mother, better than that slop at The Beeches. Ravi could rustle up some decent grub too; he said it helped him relax. Nor- man liked teasing his son-in-law. &#x201c;Fancy a takeaway?&#x201d; he would ask, wandering&nbsp; into&nbsp; the kitchen&nbsp; and&nbsp; rubbing&nbsp; his stomach.&nbsp; &#x201c;I could murder an Indian.&#x201d;<br><br>Norman had been living with them for a month now and very comfortable it was, too. He couldn&#x2019;t go back to the bungalow, of course, because it had burned down. All the fault of that damned electrician, what a cowboy. They blamed Norman,&nbsp; said he must have nodded off with a fag in his hand, but that was a lie and a slander. What were they suggesting, that he was losing his mar- bles? He might have a dicky heart&nbsp; and an occasional problem with the waterworks,&nbsp; but at least he had kept his wits unlike some people in the&nbsp; various&nbsp; penal&nbsp; institutions,&nbsp; aka&nbsp; homes,&nbsp; in which he had been incarcerated.&nbsp; Stark raving bonkers, most of them, wandering around in their nighties muttering to them- selves. His daughter had a heart of stone, sending him there. The Dettol-smelling corridors,&nbsp; the tap-tapping&nbsp; of Zimmer walkers, the rows of chairs facing the rain-lashed sea, those ghastly prison wardens who couldn&#x2019;t handle a red-blooded male, the miserable old hags. Lesbians, the lot of them.<br>And they called these places homes. Somebody had a sense of humor. Home was with his daughter in Plender Street. It was her duty to look after her old dad. And it wasn&#x2019;t as if it were a one- way thing. He made himself useful looking after the place when they were at work. Plenty of burglars around, even in Dulwich.<br>It was a gloriously sunny morning in May. Norman filled the saucepan, squirted in some Fairy Liquid and put his hankies on to boil. He was in a good mood. He&#x2019;d had his morning wank, he had emptied his bowels and had thoroughly cleared his nasal passages. What with one thing and another, he got through a lot of handkerchiefs. He had eaten a hearty breakfast&#x2014;Bran Fiber and&nbsp; three slices of&nbsp; toast&nbsp; with&nbsp; Cooper&#x2019;s Old&nbsp; English and&nbsp; that blithering low-cholesterol spread Pauline bought for him. The transistor&nbsp; around&nbsp; his neck&#x2014;he hung it there to keep his hands free&#x2014;burbled the morning news. &#x201c;The pensions time bomb,&#x201d; it said, &#x201c;is a disaster waiting to happen.&#x201d; The water came to the boil; gray scum rose to the surface. &#x201c;Over the next thirty years the elderly population will grow by two-thirds.&#x201d; Norman turned down the gas and let himself out of the house.<br>Plender Street was a pleasant street of Victorian villas&#x2014;quiet; leafy; Neighborhood&nbsp; Watch stickers in the windows. Ravi had done well for himself and Pauline must bring in a few shekels too. twinkies, they called them: Two Incomes and Something or Other.<br>A comely housewife pushed a buggy along the pavement; Norman doffed his hat to her as he walked past. She looked star- tled; good manners were a rarity nowadays, of course. He gazed after her as she quickened her pace; nice arse. Probably wasn&#x2019;t getting much rumpy-pumpy, not with a little kid around. He whistled cheerfully; another thing you didn&#x2019;t hear nowadays, whistling. This place suited him; it was his home, for God&#x2019;s sake. Nice room, meals on tap. No, they weren&#x2019;t going to get rid of him this time. He knew Pauline was searching for another peni- tentiary, she was doing it on the internet, but no luck so far.<br>Norman&nbsp; was having too much fun. Ravi was such a fusspot; he had grown worse with the passing years. Everything had to be just so. Norman&nbsp; knew just how to tease him&#x2014;flicking his fag- ends into the gas-log fire, removing his bottom&nbsp; teeth when he watched TV. He enjoyed his son-in-law&#x2019;s sharp intake of breath. Just that far, no farther. Norman&nbsp; had a well-developed sense of survival.<br>And the man was such a prude.

Its people joined the industrial age when the Chisso Corporation built a chemical factory there. The disaster that then befell them, and the ways in which some have managed to respond, reach far beyond Japan. Their courage is a flag of hope for all life - but it will have signaled no victory unless it awakens other people to action in every corner of this planet. An uneasiness developed in the town in the early 1950&#39;s. Many individuals fell ill with the same symptoms: limbs and lips tingled and then became numb; speech slurred; motor functions went out of control. Some died. Was this strange new disease contagious? Nobody knew.Minamata&#39;s disease was recognized as methyl mercury poisoning from industrial wasters. The mercury reached people through contaminated fish. Some doctors suggested that the number of persons affected might reach 10,000. So far 103 have died and some 700 others have been verified seriously - and permanently - damaged. As groups of victims pressed a turbulent, multi-sided crusade to force industry and government to take responsibility, W. Eugene Smith and his wife, Aileen, moved to Minamata. The result of their collaboration is an enduring document that crowns the work of one of the world&#39;s great photographers.</p><p></p><h2>The Lord is My Song (Chronicles of the King #2)</h2><p>With a newfound faith in the one true God, King Hezekiah leads his nation into reform and revival, bringing God&#x2019;s blessings and renewed prosperity. But not every member of his court is pleased with the king&#x2019;s &#x2019;religious fanaticism.&#x2019; And when Hezekiah stops paying tribute to Assyria, opposition to his leadership mounts. As Hezekiah seeks to obey God in every aspect of his life, he discovers that the Law forbids him to take multiple wives. He chooses Hephzibah. Their God-given love flourishes, but even here Hezekiah&#x2019;s faith will be severely tested. The king&#x2019;s precarious hold on the throne of Judah reaches critical proportions when the Assyrians invade the northern nation of Israel. A holocaust ensues, inciting ever closer to Judah and Jerusalem. One Israelite family escapes to Judah, including the young woman who just might carry the critical information Hezekiah needs to augment Jerusalem&#x2019;s defense. But with the Assyrians on the march, and his fortifications no match for their strength, can anyone really help? Paper.</p><p>Lynn N. Austin is a full-time freelance writer and speaker.

People unknowingly endanger or injure their brains, stress them by working at a frenzied pace and not getting enough sleep, pollute them with caffeine, alcohol, and drugs, and deprive them of proper nutrients. Brain dysfunction is the number one reason people fail at school, work, and relationships. The brain is the organ of learning, working, and loving&#x2014;the supercomputer that runs our lives. It&#x2019;s very simple: when our brains work right, we work right&#x2014;and when our brains have trouble, we have trouble in our lives.<br><br>Luckily, it&#x2019;s never too late: the brain is capable of change, and when you care for it, the results are amazing. <i>Making a Good Brain Great</i> gives you the tools you need to optimize your brain power and enrich your health and your life in the process.

It is in the brain that the poppy is red, that the apple is odorous, that the skylark sings, (and that we love and hate each other).</i> &#x2014;<b>Oscar Wilde</b><br><br> Your brain is involved in everything you do. This is the first principle of the Amen Clinics. The sensation of waking up cuddled next to your husband&#x2019;s or wife&#x2019;s warm body is felt in the brain. The brain directs your urge to make love and be physically close. Getting ready for the day by planning, grooming, eating, and communicating with your husband and kids is directed by the brain. Negotiating traffic, while talking on your cell phone, is a result of your brain giving orders. Managing your business, planning trips, evaluating employees, running meetings, attending luncheons, and answering e-mails are all accomplished by your brain&#x2019;s hard work. Leaving the office on time, playing tennis, lifting weights, and joking with your friends to unwind are activities spearheaded by the brain. Enjoying the sunset, helping the kids with homework, and assisting your wife with dinner are a result of moment-by-moment brain function. Your brain is the command and control center that runs your life.<br><br> Our work at the Amen Clinics is based on nine deceptively simple principles. Understanding these ideas will lay the foundation for making a good brain great. These principles stem directly from the brain-imaging work that we have been doing intensely for the past fifteen years. Do not let the simplicity of these principles fool you. If you allow them to become part of your everyday life, they will change nearly everything you do in the direct service of brain health.<br><br><b> PRINCIPLE 1: Your brain is involved in everything you do.</b><br><br> How you think, how you feel, how you act, and how well you get along with other people has to do with the moment-by-moment functioning of your brain. Most people know that the brain is the organ of behavior, but few people understand this principle at a deep emotional level. We spend more time and money on beautifying our hair, our skin, our clothes, and our homes than we do on caring for our brain. After looking at over thirty thousand brain scans, I have come to realize that how your brain works influences every part of who you are and what you do: from athletic skills to parenting, from management skills to your free time activities, from social aptitude to artistic talent, and from driving ability to the type of music you like. Look at any aspect of behavior&#x2014;relationships, school, work, religion, sports&#x2014;and in the middle of it all is brain function.<br><br> Let&#x2019;s take four common examples of behavior and look at them through the lens of this first principle: motherhood, business management, dating, and attending a sporting event.<br><br> There are many different types of mothers. There are mothers, like my own, who are outgoing, relaxed, fun-loving, upbeat, and playful. There are mothers who are more serious, who focus on their children&#x2019;s faults or tend to be too busy or preoccupied to play with them. There are mothers who constantly push their children to be their best and mothers who lead quietly by example. There are mothers who use guilt and nagging as the primary motivator of behavior, and mothers who cheer a child&#x2019;s every positive move. Ultimately, the type of mother a woman may be is determined by her brain. Mothers who are more serious tend to have higher amounts of activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The prefrontal cortex is involved with goal-setting, planning, forethought, and judgment. High PFC levels are involved with goal-oriented behavior. Outgoing, playful, less serious mothers have a little less activity in this part of the brain. Guilt-driven mothers tend to have higher activity in the brain&#x2019;s emotional centers (limbic brain), which in turn causes them to focus on the negative, such as all of her child&#x2019;s faults. Few people know that the type of mother they have has everything to do with the moment-by-moment functioning of her brain.<br><br> There are in the world just as many different types of business managers as mothers, based in part on brain function. There are motivational managers and quiet managers. There are absent managers and micromanagers. There are managers who scream and yell to get their way and managers who encourage. There are managers who enjoy firing people and managers who hold on to employees much longer than they should. Managers who have high PFC activity tend to be very involved and directive; taken to an extreme, they are micromanagers. Managers with low PFC activity tend to be idea people and relatively hands-off; taken to an extreme, they are absent. A part of the brain that we will discuss in detail later on is the anterior cingulate gyrus, which runs lengthwise through the front part of the brain. It is the brain&#x2019;s gear shifter, allowing you to be flexible and shift between tasks. Managers who have good activity in this part of the brain tend to be flexible and are able to adapt to changes in the business climate. Managers who have excessive activity in this part of the brain tend to be rigid and inflexible. These managers tend to hold on to patterns of behavior long after they are helpful. Even though brains run businesses, few people think about the brain at work.<br><br> Our species has many varied ways to, as my eighteen-year-old daughter would say, hook up. Dating and mating are brain functions, even though the urges may feel like they come from lower in your body. There are shy people who rely on random chance to find a mate. There are outgoing people who will ask a hundred or more potential partners out on a date in search of their one true love. There are thoughtful, planning daters and those who do courtship on the spur of the moment. There are commitment-phobic daters who run at the first signs of attachment and those who commit too easily. There are people who are overwhelmed by feelings of insecurity and jealousy and those who lack sufficient caring. In the center of the dating scene is the brain. The brain allows us to pay attention to potential mates, to evaluate their suitability for us, to attach, to care, and to draw people toward us or push them away. The brain helps us evaluate honesty, fidelity, and reliability. Healthy PFC activity helps us follow through on our commitments, showing the other person that we are reliable, predictable, and likely to make a good dad or mom. Lower levels of activity in the PFC will make us more spontaneous and fun (with less forethought) but may also make us late for appointments, too pushy for early sex, and more driven by emotion. We often judge our dates based on looks, but we rarely consider their brain function. I believe this will change in the coming century. In fact, if you date my daughter for more than four months, you have to get a brain scan to determine if you can continue to see her. I&#x2019;m not kidding.<br><br> There are many different types of sports fans, depending again, in part, on brain function. I watch many sports fans at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and at Angels Stadium in Anaheim, while undergoing the trials, tribulations, and joys of rooting for the Los Angeles Lakers and the Anaheim Angels. My big brother, Jim, is an intense fan. He yells at the referees and umpires when he thinks they make a mistake, and he often loudly second-guesses the coaches and managers when they play the subs. There are quiet fans who show little emotion and fans who seem as though they are going to wet their pants when the home team makes a mistake. There are forgiving fans and fans who hold grudges. There are fans who lack PFC activity and throw objects onto the court or field and fans with high PFC activity who worry the whole game through. There are fans who are rude to people who wear opposing jerseys and fans who make friends with the people around them. There are pseudofans who show up to be seen (Lakers games are always events), and fans who cry when the home team loses. There are family fans who use sporting events as a bonding mechanism, between father and son (or in my case, between father and two daughters). As the brain is involved in athletic skill, it is also involved in the type of sports fan you are.<br><br> The first principle, like all of the principles, is very simple. Your brain is involved in every aspect of your life and the person you are.</p><h2>Hand, Reef and Steer</h2><p>Hand reef and steer</p><p></p><h2>Rag Rugs: How to Use Ancient and Modern Rug-Making Techniques to Create Rugs, Wallhangings, Even Jewelry (Contemporary Crafts)</h2><p>Discusses the history of rag rugs, introduces the equipment and techniques, and provides detailed instructions for making twelve projects, from throw rugs to jewelry</p><p></p><h2>Eternal Life: A New Vision: Beyond Religion, Beyond Theism, Beyond Heaven and Hell</h2><p>Drawing on a lifetime of wisdom, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and controversial religious leader John Shelby Spong continues to challenge traditional Christian theology in <em>Eternal Life: A New Vision</em>.

In <em>Eternal Life: A New Vision</em>, a remarkable spiritual journey about his lifelong struggle with the questions of God and death, he reveals how he came to a new conviction about eternal life. God, says spong, is ultimately one, and each of us is part of that oneness. We do not live on after death as children who have been rewarded with heaven or punished with hell but as part of the life and being of God, sharing in God&#x2019;s eternity, which is beyond the barriers of time and space. spong argues that the discovery of the eternal can be found within each of us if we go deeply into ourselves, transcend our limits and become fully human. By seeking God within, by living each day to its fullest, we will come to understand how we live eternally.</p><p>Always compelling and controversial, Spong, the leading Christian liberal and pioneer for human rights, wrestles with the question that all of us will ultimately face. In his final book, Spong takes us beyond religion and even beyond Christianity until he arrives at the affirmation that the fully realized human life empties into and participates in the eternity of God. The pathway into God turns out to be both a pathway into ourselves and a doorway into eternal life.

Now a new generation will surely be won over by Paddington&#x2019;s particular brand of preposterous humor and gentle satire. The Browns first meet Paddington on a railway platform in London. He is sitting on a battered suitcase, wearing an odd-looking hat and a sign around his neck that reads, Please look after this bear. Thank you.&#x201d; And that is just what they do, unaware that home will never be the same once Paddington becomes a member of the family.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Brown first met Paddington--a most endearing bear from Darkest Peru--on a railway platform in London. A sign hanging around his neck said, "Please look after this bear. Thank you" So that is just what they did.<p></p><p>From the very first night when he attempted his first bath and ended up nearly flooding the house, Paddington was seldom far from imminent disaster. Jonathan and Judy were delighted with this havoc and even Mr. and Mrs. Brown had to admit that life seemed to be more filled with adventure when there was a bear in the house.</p>I wrote my first children's book in 1957 and it came about largely by accident. At that time I had been a part-time writer for about ten years, following a common progression in those days: short stories, newspaper and magazine articles, radio plays, plus a few short plays for television, I thought it was a good year if I sold one piece in ten. <p>Without giving the matter any great thought, I had always regarded writing for children as a lesser form of creativity-quite untrue, of course. As Gertrude Stein might have said-a book is a book is a book, and writing is perhaps even more of an agonizing process of distillation when it's for children. </p><p>There being nothing more soul-destroying than staring at a blank sheet of paper hoping something will happen (it won't unless you make it), I was sitting at the typewriter one morning when my gaze happened to alight on a toy bear I had bought my wife for Christmas. We called him Paddington, so I typed the words: "Mr and Mrs. Brown first met Paddington on a railway platform. In fact that was how he came to have such an unusual name for a bear, for Paddington was the name of the station." </p><p>Suddenly, I wanted to write more about this small character. Where had he come from? What was he doing in London? What were his reactions to life in England and the curious complications we humans make for ourselves? </p><p>Until that time I had always thought up stories and then tried to people them with characters. Suddenly, I learned a very simple fact of fictional life. If you create a believable character and you place it into a situation, events will develop naturally of their own accord. </p><p>Many of my radio and television plays had been light comedies which more often than not were returned with the comment "Sorry-no call for fantasy" written across the rejection slip. Nonsense, of course: All works of fiction are fantasy, and nothing could be more so than the concept of a bear with a penchant for marmalade sandwiches, who lives in Notting Hill Gate and speaks perfectly good English. But until then, I hadn't learned the trick of making it seem believable. That won't happen unless both you, the writer, and the characters in the story believe in it, too. </p><p>I wrote the first chapter very quickly, instinctively putting in all the things I felt I would have wanted as a child. More followed, and in ten days I had a finished book. </p><p>In retrospect, some thirty-five years and many books later, I think most fictional characters who enjoy longevity do so because someone, somewhere, at some time wrote about them for the very simple reason that they wanted to. </p><p>The first book of any series is the most fun to write; everything is fresh and exciting, and you can go anywhere your fancy takes you. Recapturing the original mood in subsequent books isn't always easy. Parameters have been set which dictate future stories; what the characters can and can't do. Paddington has the best of all worlds; he combines the naivet of a small child with the sophistication of an adult, plus ingredient "X"-his own peculiar brand of logic. Being a bear, he gets away with things without seeming precocious. The stories wouldn't work were he a small child. </p><p>Children hate being written down to or made to feel they are being patronized. They like their heroes to come out on top and the feeling of comfort that goes with a safe return to base or the comfort of a home. They also-quite rightly-dislike being sold short. </p><p>I hold the old-fashioned view that stories should have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and the hardest part with Paddington is not getting him into trouble-he does this of his own accord-but getting him out of it in a way which is morally justifiable; someone must always benefit from his misdeeds however tenuously. </p><p>If fiction does nothing else, it provides a window on the world; perhaps showing things from a different viewpoint; even if-as in the case of another series I write about a guinea-pig called Olga da Polga-that window happens to be part of a hutch. </p><p>I once received a letter from a child who said she liked my books because they made pictures in her head. It was the nicest compliment I've ever had.</p></p><h2>Dragon&#39;s Play: A New Taoist Transmission of the Complete Experience of Human Life</h2><p>Dragon&#39;s Play is an entertaining story with a vast and classical purpose.

Bingham and Colleen Smith <br> Strawbale building experts Wayne J. Bingham and Colleen Smith present 30 unique plans to build a strawbale home, along with stunning photographs that illustrate projects from around the world. A broad range of building types, from small retreats and rural off-the-grid homes to urban houses and commercial buildings are featured. <br> Benefits of strawbale building: <br> It is the healthiest and most energy-saving building option.<br> Results in dramatic reductions on heating and cooling bills.<br> Significantly decreases the risk of allergies from airborne molds, pollens, and toxins.<br> Strawbale houses offer 3 times the fire resistance of conventional construction. <br> Is a green building option, which has been a hot topic in national media.<br></p><p>Strawbale homes and buildings are beautiful and personal works of art constructed by hand. The idea of building with strawbale is appealing to many because of its energy efficiency, insulative qualities, and organic nature. But the nitty-gritty of how to build with this alternative material often deters would-be strawbale aficionados. Practical information to guide you on a journey to constructing simply and naturally is hard to come by. But now your search is over. <br> Strawbale Home Plans is an inspiring and diverse collection of strawbale buildings. It features everything from single-level country homes, to cottages and studios, to community buildings. Thirty-one completed projects are highlighted. You will find helpful lessons in the homeowners' descriptions of their experiences with strawbale building as well as in the authors' explorations of the special features of each strawbale structure. Each project includes a plan drawing that provides inspiration for those who want to take their strawbale idea from conception to completion. <br> If you were waiting to start building your strawbale dream home or other alternative structure until you found just the right resource, the time has come to break out the bales and the hand tools. Professional builders and do-it-yourselfers will find tips and tricks from strawbalers-in-the-know in this essential handbook to successful baling with heart and soul. <br> Wayne J. Bingham and Colleen F. Smith, a husband-and-wife team, have been involved since 1998 in strawbale design and building. Their interest is an outgrowth of an exploration of energy efficiency and sustainable building techniques. In the mid-1990s, they attended several American Institute of Architects green-building conferences, where they began to understand the need for finding new ways to build that do not endanger the earth and its resources. <br> Seeking a direction of their own, they went on a natural-building odyssey to the Southwest to evaluate cob, adobe, rammed-earth, earthship, and strawbale buildings. They considered thermal performance, beauty, feel, and construction techniques and concluded that strawbale building held the greatest potential. <br> Wayne and Colleen attended Bill and Athena Steen's Canelo Project strawbale and earthen plaster workshops and developed a love affair with these materials that has not abated. Wayne immediately plastered the concrete-block garden wall in their backyard with earthen plaster. They returned to the Steens in 1999 to spend a year involved with workshops, construction, and collaboration with Bill and Athena on the development and production of Small Strawbale: Natural Homes, Projects &amp; Designs (2005, Gibbs Smith, Publisher). <br> Avid photographers and travelers, Wayne and Colleen have searched out and documented indigenous buildings in the United States, Greece, Great Britain, and Italy and have developed a large library of images that laid the groundwork for Strawbale Home Plans. They took additional trips to explore and further record specific strawbale buildings that now constitute this book. <br> In addition to Wayne's working with owners and builders on natural timber frame strawbale home designs and conducting workshops, the couple has put their experience into building a timber frame strawbale home of their own in Teton Valley, Idaho. <br><p>Wayne Bingham has worked as building program director for the state of Utah for ten years and has been in private architectural practice for twenty years. He was instrumental in developing and building the AIA Habitat for Humanity house, and served as chairperson of the AIA Committee on the Environment. His work has been published in Architectural Digest and Popular Science, among others. Bill is building a straw bale home in Teton Valley, Idaho.</p><br><br>Wayne J.

It is, as one might imagine, a mystery. But it is also a love story and the love is as passionate and fervent as one could imagine. It is a story of the love of nature, of science and the scientific method, and of isolated and lonely human beings who learn to care not only for others, but equally important, for themselves. This deluxe Children&#x2019;s Classic edition is produced with high-quality, leatherlike binding with gold stamping, full-color covers, colored endpapers with a book nameplate. Some of the other titles in this series include: Anne of Green Gables, Black Beauty, King Arthur and His Knights, Little Women, and Treasure Island.</p><p>Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Missalthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>Topsy: The Startling Story of the Crooked Tailed Elephant, P.T. Barnum, and the American Wizard, Thomas Edison</h2><p>In 1903, on Coney Island, an elephant named Topsy was electrocuted, and over the past century, this bizarre, ghoulish execution has reverberated through popular culture with the whiff of urban legend. But it really happened, and many historical forces conspired to bring Topsy, Thomas Edison, and those 6600 volts of alternating current together that day. Tracing them all in <i>Topsy The Startling Story of the Crooked Tailed Elephant, P.T. Barnum, and the American Wizard, Thomas Edison</i>, journalist Michael Daly weaves together a fascinating popular history, the first book on this astonishing tale.<br><br>At the turn of the century, the circus in America was at its apex with the circuses of P.T. Barnum and Adam Forepaugh (or 4-Paw) competing in a War of the Elephants, with declarations of whose pachyderms were younger, bigger, or more sacred&#x201d;. This brought Topsy to America, fraudulently billed as the first native-born, and caught between the circus disputes and the War of the Currents, in which Edison and George Westinghouse (and Nikola Tesla) battled over alternating versus direct current.<br><br>Rich in period Americana, and full of circus tidbits and larger than life characters both human and elephant Topsy is a touching tale and an entertaining read.<br></p><p>Michael Daly has been a newspaper journalist and columnist for many years, currently with the New York <i>Daily News</i>.

In the midst of a nightmarish New England drought, cynical ski industry lobbyist Scottie Winston is trying to get a large ski resort the permits it needs to tap already beleaguered rivers for snow. His wife, his little girl, and his sister-in-law -- dowsers or "water witches" all -- hope to stop him, however, in this gentle, comic, life-affirming novel.</p><p>5 1/2 x 8 1/2 trim. LC 94-9816Vermont is drying up. The normally lush, green countryside is in the grip of the worst drought in years: stunted cornstalks rasp in the hot July breeze, parched vegetable gardens wither and die, the Chittenden River shrinks to a trickle, and the drilling trucks are booked solid as one by one the wells give out. Patience Avery, known nationwide as a gifted &#34;water witch&#34;, is having a busy summer, too. Using the tools of the dowser&#39;s trade - divining sticks, metal rods, bobbers, and pendulums - she can locate, among other things, aquifers deep within the earth. In the midst of this crisis, Scottie Winston lobbies for permits to expand Powder Peak, a local ski area that&#39;s his law firm&#39;s principal client. As part of the expansion, the resort seeks to draw water for snowmaking from the beleaguered Chittenden, despite opposition from environmentalists who fear that the already weakened river will be damaged beyond repair.</p><h2>Women Sailors and Sailors&#39; Women: An Untold Maritime History</h2><p>For centuries the sea has been regarded as a male domain. Fisherman, navy officers, pirates, and explorers roamed the high seas while their wives and daughters stayed on shore. Oceangoing adventurers and the crews of their ships were part of an all-male world &#x2014; or were they?<br><br>In this illuminating historical narrative, maritime scholar David Cordingly shows that in fact an astonishing number of women went to sea in the great age of sail. Some traveled as the wives or mistresses of captains. A few were smuggled aboard by officers or seaman. A number of cases have come to light of young women dressing in men&#x2019;s clothes and working alongside the sailors for months, and sometimes years. In the U.S. and Britsh navies, it was not uncommon for the wives of bosuns, carpenters, and cooks to go to sea on warships. Cordingly&#x2019;s tremendous research shows that there was indeed a thriving female population &#x2014; from female pirates to the sirens of legend &#x2014; on and around the high seas.

Wells: Desperately Mortal : A Biography</h2><p>This biography focuses on the literary figure&#39;s enormously active public career and his intellectual and creative achievements, reveals how this classic womanizer remained consistently attractive to feminists, and examines his relationship with pivotal figures of the age</p><p>Viewing human destiny as a race between education and catastrophe, Wells tried to educate the world as to the evils of simple-minded patriotism, racism, nationalism and science run amok. A socialist, a veritable writing machine and self-appointed spokesman for the Bolshevik revolution, the novelist-historian who began as a draper's apprentice rejected Marx's concept of class warfare. He called instead for a world state in which rewards for bad behavior would be eliminated. Smith's biographical-critical study, stodgily written, traces the ties between Wells's prolific literary output and his socialist creed, his two marriages and numerous sexual adventures, his prickly relations with Conrad, James and the Fabians, and his feminist views. Although he never actively campaigned for women's suffrage, Wells championed women's right to birth control and, in his fiction, advocated sexual freedom. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Monsieur Mediocre: One American Learns the High Art of Being Everyday French</h2><p><b>A hilarious, candid account of what life in France is <i>actually</i> like, from a writer for <i>Vanity Fair </i>and <i>GQ</i></b><br><br>Americans love to love Paris. We buy books about how the French parent, why French women don't get fat, and how to be Parisian wherever you are. While our work hours increase every year, we think longingly of the six weeks of vacation the French enjoy, imagining them at the seaside in stripes with plates of <i>fruits de mer.</i><br><br>John von Sothen fell in love with Paris through the stories his mother told of her year spent there as a student. And then, after falling for and marrying a French waitress he met in New York, von Sothen moved to Paris. But fifteen years in, he's finally ready to admit his mother's Paris is mostly a fantasy. In this hilarious and delightful collection of essays, von Sothen walks us through real life in Paris--not only myth-busting our Parisian daydreams but also revealing the inimitable and too often invisible pleasures of family life abroad. <br><br>Relentlessly funny and full of incisive observations, <i>Monsieur Mediocre</i> is ultimately a love letter to France--to its absurdities, its history, its ideals--but it's a very <i>French</i> love letter: frank, smoky, unsentimental. It is a clear-eyed ode to a beautiful, complex, contradictory country from someone who both eagerly and grudgingly calls it home.</p><p>John von Sothen is an American columnist living in Paris, where he covers entertainment and society issues for French <i>Vanity Fair</i>. Von Sothen has written for both the American and French <i>GQ, Slate, Technikart, Lib�ration, </i>and <i>The New York Observer</i>; he has written for TV at Canal+ and MTV; and he is now penning a column for the political site <i>Mediapart.</i> Von Sothen often does voice-overs in English for French perfumes and luxury brands, occasionally performs stand-up comedy at The New York Comedy Night in the SoGymnase Comedy Club in Paris (in French and English), and is a routine guest on the French radio station Europe 1 discussing all things US related.<b>Introduction&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b><br><br>Like many Parisian families, we occasionally rent our apartment out on Airbnb. It&#x2019;s not an easy process, but it is practical, and as&nbsp;long as you can power through the tedious chore of prepping your house and fielding calls from guests who forgot the code to your building, it does provide some disposable income that&#x2019;s handy for all those school year vacations that pop up in France like measles every six weeks.<br><br>What many Parisian families DO NOT do is rent out their apartment while they&#x2019;re not on vacation and when their kids are still in school, which is exactly what we did one year by accident, forgetting that the Easter break for families in the south of France hits a week earlier than that in Paris. We realized this fun fact days before our guests arrived, which sent us scrambling to find alternative lodging (on Airbnb of course) in Montmartre, a hop skip and another hop away from our own place in the Tenth Arrondissement.<br><br> Sure, it felt odd to pack up our clothes, the printer, plus the dog and cat, hair dryers and book bags, just to hoof it three metro stops west for a week. And yes, it was a bit bizarre to pass your own apartment in the morning on your way to school (now a twenty-minute schlep) and see the window of your bathroom fogged up from a stranger probably fucking in your shower.<br><br> But in the end, the week turned out not half bad. It forced my family to break up a rut we didn&#x2019;t know we were in, and gave us the chance to see a part of Paris we hadn&#x2019;t had time to visit much. And it was during this impromptu staycation in Montmartre, dining out early with the kids at restaurants or ducking into a caf� for a beer midday or riding the bus (the bus?) and taking photos from the window of that bus, that I felt, for the first time in fifteen years, like an American in Paris. A tad curious, kind of stupid, and with much too much energy, not unlike the other Americans I saw in Montmartre that week, marching up single file to the Sacr� Coeur church, where they&#x2019;d take in a breathtaking view of Paris while also being pickpocketed.<br><br> Some were backpackers on Snapchat, others were orthopedic-shoed retirees carrying on about Sedona. And although each looked winded and footsore, each had an enthusiasm for Paris I hadn&#x2019;t felt in a long time. How could they not? Although it was now a bit Disney-fied, Montmatre had been the foothold for artists like Picasso and Modigliani and American expat writers like Langston Hughes, and its allure and romance were still potent. The streets were cobblestone and smoothed by time. Chickens turned on those sidewalk rotisseries. People leaned on flipped-over wine casks smacking back oysters and Muscadet.<br><br> I myself probably rounded out the clich�, a real-life Parisian writer in his peacoat and five-day-old scruff scribbling in his Moleskine what the world would never understand but which had to be written. Little did these tourists know, I was just as lost as them, and had they&#x2019;d asked me in their X-KUSAY MOI MESSSUR French where the Moulin Rouge was, or in which restaurant Picasso traded his paintings for meals, I couldn&#x2019;t have helped. Because as a Parisian, I wouldn&#x2019;t be caught dead at any of them. Yet at the same time it burned me how I&#x2019;d lost the innocence for this place. I&#x2019;d strayed so far off the range and gone so deep into the recesses of French life that Montmartre now seemed Vegas to me.<br><br> Before I knew it, the week was over and I was back in my own Paris, a grafittied, kebab-standed, trash-strewn enclave near the Gare du Nord, feeling as if I&#x2019;d just had an affair with another neighborhood. And like any cheater, I immediately tried to mask my guilt by finding fault with my present home. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t it feel nice to just sit outside and hear that accordion play?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d mention to my wife, Ana�s. I&#x2019;d go on and on, harping about the cakes in the windows and the antique dealers, telling Ana�s what a relief it was to not hear sirens or to not have my conscience weighed down as I consider the circumstances of the refugees we pass every day on the way to the subway. (Yes, we&#x2019;ve had refugee camps in the Tenth&#x2014;probably because we didn&#x2019;t try to evict them as other arrondissements have done.) But in my comparisons, I missed that our own Bohemian digs aren&#x2019;t all that much different from what Montmartre had been back in the day. Ana�s knows this though, and she&#x2019;s keen enough to see how attached I actually am to our place. She even coined an expression&#x2014;she claims she made it up, but it sounds too profound for that to be true<i>&#x2014;&#x201c;On critique bien, ce qu&#x2019;on aime le mieux.&#x201d; </i>(We critique best what we love the most.)<br><br> She&#x2019;s right. I love my adoptive home; so much so, I feel I&#x2019;m entitled now to flame it <i>� la Fran�aise. </i>Yet what I&#x2019;m zinging isn&#x2019;t the French institutions themselves, but the Instagram version we Americans have imposed upon them.<br><br> Within every best-selling book about France, there&#x2019;s no doubt love, but it&#x2019;s always been on our terms and one-way. We have this infatua- tion with keeping France a quaint and charming dollhouse. If the vi- sion isn&#x2019;t forged by Impressionist paintings, it&#x2019;s forged by cantankerous civil servants who strike on a daily basis or farmhouses basking in lavender fields or a workplace where emails after 5:00 p.m. aren&#x2019;t opened. If it&#x2019;s not warm baguettes and good wine, it&#x2019;s angelic kids in Bon Point standing next to chic and severe mothers who don&#x2019;t get fat. According to these best sellers, France isn&#x2019;t on the cusp of anything. It&#x2019;s in the preservation business, keeping civilization alive while the rest of the world goes to Best Buy.<br><br> When I moved here fifteen years ago, I, too, was under the spell of a rose-colored France. I had in my head that I&#x2019;d be eating six-course dinners while vacationing three months a year with my French actress wife, all while promenading down the Seine with gloves and walking stick. The reality has proven quite different. But not in a bad way, just in a real-life, run-of-the-mill, everyday (let&#x2019;s say mediocre) way that anybody who&#x2019;s working and raising kids, walking dogs, trying to get the Internet installed, paying a mortgage, and struggling to help with homework he himself doesn&#x2019;t understand can relate to.<br><br> For me, Paris is a mess, a confusing, roiling, weird place. If any- thing, it&#x2019;s America now with its Supreme T-shirt pop-up sales and cupcake parlors and hoverboards and Google stores that looks clean and vanilla and safe. Anytime I&#x2019;m back in New York for work, it&#x2019;s me who takes on the clueless glaze of those Montmartre backpackers, wondering how the deli I used to buy forty ounces at suddenly became an office building or why everyone feels obliged now to crank the AC in March. I&#x2019;ll question why Amtrak can&#x2019;t modernize, or how I missed the whole sippy cup craze, and it&#x2019;s during these ruminations that I real- ize what the person across from me has pegged me for&#x2014;everyday Eurotrash.<br><br> My life in France, I tell my friends, is a lot like going back in time to the United States in the seventies, when the cities were rugged, cap gains were high, public schools were still doable, economic growth was minimal, people drank at lunch, and the national fabric and social net were intact, warts and all. When my American friends visit and I tell them this, I see there&#x2019;s a slight twinkle of newfound romance for France, based on a new set of criteria. There&#x2019;s also relief. France, the way I pitch it, isn&#x2019;t perfect at all. And because of that, it&#x2019;s accessible and, for the most part, English speaking, just like the rest of the world. Sure the Brie, Bordeaux, and baguette thing still exists, but it doesn&#x2019;t define our life here. Plus those are things you can easily find in Man- hattan or Mumbai or Berkeley as well.<br><br> What you can&#x2019;t find though is a Doctor Benayoun who comes to my house at midnight to give me a flu shot raving about Miami and how we should go in on a condo together; or the professor I see when I walk my dog each night teaching French on his off time from a paper board in the cold rain to Syrian refugees camped in our park. Nor can you find my aristocrat father-in-law, who has two children my own children&#x2019;s ages and who has no qualms about asking me to babysit. Enduring love, I&#x2019;ve learned, is when you&#x2019;re smitten by something or someone for one reason, but you end up loyal to them for another.<br><br> Since our Montmartre staycation five years ago, we&#x2019;ve made it a point each year to recreate it. We rent out our place during a work/ school week, throw together the suitcases and dog food and book bags and staplers, and live for a few days somewhere else in Paris. We &#x2019;ve done Bastille. We&#x2019;ve done Le Marais. And this year we&#x2019;re venturing out to the no man&#x2019;s land of the Fifteenth. And just as with our time in Montmartre, we&#x2019;ll admire the scenes or walk the Seine or check out a museum. Hell, we might even buy souvenirs. And in doing so, I&#x2019;ll once again feel like someone in the audience eating popcorn as he watches the stage production of &#x201c;<i>Paris</i>!!&#x201d;<br><br> Invariably the clock will strike twelve and we&#x2019;ll return home, hop- ing the lucky family staying in our apartment had as much fun as we did. But judging from our Airbnb reviews, the compliments usually stop at the size of our loft. Most are a litany of masked disappointments. The bathroom towels were worn out, or they didn&#x2019;t exactly love the street, the neighborhood was a bit too noisy and rough, a bit off the beaten trail. Our home in the Tenth wasn&#x2019;t the Paris they thought they&#x2019;d be visiting, at least not the one featured in all those books they&#x2019;d bought at the airport. And in reading the feedback out loud in English to my cackling family and puzzled dog, I realize now how far from home an American can feel when he says in a perfectly accented French huff <i>. . . &#x201c;Ooh la la . . . les Am�ricains!</i></p><h2>The Rancho Gordo Vegetarian Kitchen</h2><p>Rancho Gordo's Steve Sando and Julia Newberry share their recipes and secrets for foolproof mostly bean-based vegetarian cooking with over 60 recipes, plus tips and ideas to inspire you in your kitchen. <p> Because beans are the stars of the show, the recipes are organized by type of bean: white and light beans, medium-bodied beans, dark beans, and non-natives and grains.

He had an adventurous life -- as a baby he was carried by his father to the top of the Old Man of Coniston, a peak that is 2,276 ft high! He went to Russia in 1913 to study folklore and in 1914, at the start of World War I he became a foreign correspondent for the <i>Daily News</i>. In 1917 when the Russian Revolution began he became a journalist and was a special correspondent of the <i>Guardian</i>. He played chess with Lenin and married Trotsky's personal secretary, Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina. On their return to England, he bought a cottage near Windermere in the Lake District and began writing children's stories. In a 1958 author's note, Ransome wrote: ''I have been often asked how I came to write <i>Swallows and Amazons.</i> The answer is that it had its beginning long, long ago when, as children, my brother, my sisters and I spent most of our holidays on a farm at the south end of Coniston. We played in or on the lake or on the hills above... Going away from it we were half drowned in tears. While away from it, as children and as grown-ups, we dreamt about it. No matter where I was, wandering about the world, I used at night to look for the North Star and, in my mind's eye, could see the beloved sky-line of great hills beneath it. <i>Swallows</i> grew out of those old memories. I could not help writing it. It almost wrote itself.'' He published the first of his children's classics, the 12 <i>Swallows and Amazons </i>books, in 1930. In 1936 he won the first ever Carnegie Medal for his book, <i>Pigeon Post</i>. He died in 1967.</p><h2>Bigfoot; The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality</h2><p>Bigfoot is my collective name for the giant-sized man-like creatures that are believed to inhabit the boreal forests of north-west America and in the snowfields of the Himalayas.

Feynman inspired a generation of students with his energetic, unorthodox style of teaching. Drawn from his celebrated and landmark text Lectures on Physics, &#34;Six Easy Pieces&#34; reveals Feynman&#39;s distinctive style while introducing the essentials of physics to the general reader. The topics explored include atoms, the fundamentals of physics and its relation to other sciences, the theory of gravitation and quantum behaviour. &#39;If one book was all that could be passed on to the next generation of scientists it would undoubtedly have to be &#34;Six Easy Pieces&#34;&#39; - John Gribbin, &#34;New Scientist&#34;.</p><p>Richard P. Feynman (1918-88) was one of this century&#39;s most brilliant and original thinkers. He taught at Cornell and the California Institute of Technology and received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in quantum electrodynamics. Books by Feynman published by Penguin include QED, and THE CHARACTER OF PHYSICAL LAW. Forthcoming: THE MEANING OF IT ALL (May 98) and SIX NOT-SO-EASY PIECES (September 98).This book reprints the six easiest chapters from Feynman's celebrated Lectures on Physics (LJ 12/15/63), which the Nobel Prize-winning scientist delivered from 1961 to 1963 at the California Institute of Technology. Intended for as wide an audience as possible, these chapters are primarily qualitative in nature, with a minimum of formal mathematics. They discuss atoms, basic physics, the relation of physics to other sciences, the conservation of energy, gravitation, and quantum behavior. While this informative work provides a relevant historical perspective on the essentials of physics, the result is somewhat superficial. Nonetheless, because Lectures on Physics is out of print and because the information is still relevant, reprinting these specific chapters was probably a realistic move. The material will be readily understood by scholars, physics students, and informed lay readers. Recommended for academic and public libraries.

Polity style! <br><br> The Polity Collective is the pinnacle of space-faring civilization. Academic and insightful, its dominion stretches from Earth Central into the unfathomable reaches of the galactic void. But when the Polity finally encounters alien life in the form of massive, hostile, crablike carnivores known as the Prador, there can be only one outcome... total warfare. <br><br> Chaos reigns as the Polity, caught unawares, struggles to regain its foothold and transition itself into a military society. Starships clash, planets fall, and space stations are overrun, but for Jebel Krong and Moria Salem, two unlikely heroes trapped at the center of the action, this war is far more than a mere clash of cultures, far more than technology versus brute force... this war is personal. <br><br> Epic in scope, unrelenting in action, Prador Moon delivers the blistering battles and astounding literary pyrotechnics that fans of Neal Asher, author of Gridlinked, The Line of Polity, and The Skinner, have come to expect. Prador Moon is Asher&#x2019;s latest and most shocking excursion into the Polity&#x2019;s universe of over-the-top violence and explosive action. Asher delivers a vivid, visceral, brilliantly intense space opera that you won&#x2019;t soon forget.</p><p><b>Neal Asher</b> is a science fiction writer whose work has been nominated for both the Philip K. Dick and the British Fantasy Society awards. He has published more than fifteen books, many set within his Polity&#x201d; universe, including <i>Gridlinked</i>, <i>The Skinner</i>, and <i>Dark Intelligence</i>. He divides his time between Essex and a home in Crete.<br>The Polity, a space-faring civilization ruled mostly by AIs because only they can cope with the math for the runcible operation enabling interstellar travel, has just made first contact. No one knew quite what to expect of the crablike Prador's visit to Avalon Station, though the massacre that ensued wasn't on anybody's list. Seems the bloodthirsty Prador are bent on taking over the Polity and its runcible technology, and the Polity powers that be must scrambled to get to have any chance of defeating them. Jebel Krong, a soldier on Avalon when the aliens arrived, and runcible tech Moria Salem, recently cerebrally augmented to handle the technology, are thrown together in a classic space-opera scenario in which two wild cards are the private surgeon who installed Moria's aug--a fugitive--and the aug itself, which is more than ordinary. The Prador invasion and Polity politics are revealed as horribly intertwined, but Moria and Jebel might end the war with a particularly bold plan. A fast and furious spectacle developed with gusto. <i>Regina Schroeder</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

THE TWELVE The epic sequel to THE PASSAGE</p><p><p><b>An Exclusive Essay by Author Justin Cronin</b></p> <p>Readers often ask where I get my ideas. The better question would be: Where don&#x2019;t I?</p> <p>Many people know that <em>The Passage</em> was born from a challenge laid down by my eight-year-old daughter to write the story of &#x201c;a girl who saves the world.&#x201d; This wasn&#x2019;t exactly what I wanted to hear&#x2014;it seemed a trifle ambitious&#x2014;but a dare is a dare. For the next three months she joined me on my daily jog, following along on her bicycle, while the two of us hashed out the plot. As the weeks passed, I realized we were onto something much better than the book I was supposed to be writing. I put that book aside, wrote the first chapter of <em>The Passage</em>, and never looked back. </p> <p>So don&#x2019;t ever think you shouldn&#x2019;t listen to your kids.</p> <p>But my daughter&#x2019;s challenge wasn&#x2019;t the only inspiration. When I write a novel, my goal is to put absolutely everything I have into its pages, right down to the interesting thing that happened yesterday. I know I&#x2019;m done when my mind feels as empty as a leaky bucket. So many influences, real and imagined, went into <em>The Passage</em> that I couldn&#x2019;t list them if I tried. But one memory that stands out is the night my family and I tried to flee Houston in advance of hurricane Rita. Apparently, about a million other people had the same idea. After five hours on the road, we&#x2019;d made it all of sixty miles. The highways were clogged with cars that had long since run out of gas; every minimart and gas station had been picked clean. I jumped the median and made it home in a little under an hour, my gas gauge floating just above &#x2018;E&#x2019;.</p> <p>Rita missed Houston, slamming into a less-inhabited section of Texas and Louisiana coastline. But the experience of being in a large urban evacuation, with its feeling of barely-bottled panic, was one I&#x2019;ll never forget, and is everywhere in the pages of <em>The Passage</em>.</p> <p>So where did <em>The Twelve</em> come from?</p> <p>Again, many places. But if I had to pick one source, it would be the strong women in my life. No bones about it: Gentlemen, if you doubt for a second that women are tougher than we are, go watch one have a baby. So here you have Alicia, the woman warrior with her blades and crossbow; here you have Amy, the spiritual leader and visionary; here you have one of my favorite new characters, Lore DeVeer, whose mechanical savvy is matched only by her unbridled sensuality; here you have a fourth woman (sorry, can&#x2019;t tell you who) whose maternal strength is as powerful as any great spectacle of nature. As I wrote <em>The Twelve</em>, I came to understand that these powerful characters were the backbone of the tale. Even more, they are a tribute to all the amazing women I am privileged to know, befriend, and in one very lucky instance, marry.</p> <p>Hope you enjoy <em>The Twelve</em>.

It provides instructions, wildly illustrated with colorful cartoons, for spells, superstitions, recipes, gardening, and glamour. In a crazy mixture of realism and witchcraft, one finds, for example, a recipe for "dubious trifle," which gives directions for making flies from raisins and slivered almonds. Witches are portrayed basically as nasty and disgusting creatures, but they are never without a sense of humor. Their lives as portrayed in The Witch's Handbook are almost as inviting (but not as detailed) as those of the gnomes in Huygen's book (Abrams, 1977).

Now, in Boom!, one of America&#x2019;s premier journalists gives us an epic portrait of another defining era in America as he brings to life the tumultuous Sixties, a fault line in American history. The voices and stories of both famous people and ordinary citizens come together as Brokaw takes us on a memorable journey through a remarkable time, exploring how individual lives and the national mindset were affected by a controversial era and showing how the aftershocks of the Sixties continue to resound in our lives today. In the reflections of a generation, Brokaw also discovers lessons that might guide us in the years ahead. <br><br>Boom! One minute it was Ike and the man in the grey flannel suit, and the next minute it was time to &#x201c;turn on, tune in, drop out.&#x201d; While Americans were walking on the moon, Americans were dying in Vietnam. Nothing was beyond question, and there were far fewer answers than before.<br><br>Published as the fortieth anniversary of 1968 approaches, <i>Boom!</i> gives us what Brokaw sees as a virtual reunion of some members of &#x201c;the class of &#x2019;68,&#x201d; offering wise and moving reflections and frank personal remembrances about people&#x2019;s lives during a time of high ideals and profound social, political, and individual change. What were the gains, what were the losses? Who were the winners, who were the losers? As they look back decades later, what do members of the Sixties generation think really mattered in that tumultuous time, and what will have meaning going forward? <br><br>Race, war, politics, feminism, popular culture, and music are all explored here, and we learn from a wide range of people about their lives. Tom Brokaw explores how members of this generation have gone on to bring activism and a Sixties mindset into individual entrepreneurship today. We hear stories of how this formative decade has led to a recalibrated perspective&#x2013;on business, the environment, politics, family, our national existence. <br><br>Remarkable in its insights, profoundly moving, wonderfully written and reported, this revealing portrait of a generation and of an era, and of the impact of the 1960s on our lives today, lets us be present at this reunion ourselves, and join in these frank conversations about America then, now, and tomorrow.</p><p>Tom Brokaw is the author of four bestsellers: <i>The Greatest Generation, The Greatest Generation Speaks, An Album of Memories</i>, and <i>A Long Way from Home</i>.

The country was in the midst of a cultural upheaval unlike anything experienced since the Roaring Twenties. Everyone wondered whether America could regain its balance.<br><br>Forty years later, another war, this one in the Middle East, was deeply dividing the United States. Republican and Democratic candidates for president were laying out starkly different scenarios for the country&#x2019;s future. The place of America in the world was hotly debated. The popular culture was again an issue.<br><br>The eve of 2008 was not exactly the Sixties all over again, but we still have a lot to learn from that memorable, stimulating, dangerous, and maddening time in American life forty years ago.<br><br>I arrived in Los Angeles to join NBC News in 1966, and by then, Charles Dickens&#x2019;s opening lines in A Tale of Two Cities had never seemed so prophetic. Were these the best or the worst of times? I wish I could say I felt the tremors of seismic change beginning and spreading out across the political and cultural landscape, but I was mostly trying to find my way. I was a twenty-six-year-old pilgrim from the prairie heartland, raised with the sensibilities of a Fifties working-class family. I was the father of a toddler with another child on the way.<br><br>I fit the prototype of the typical young white male of the time. I had been a crew-cut apostle of the Boy Scouts, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, attending Sunday school and church, drinking too much beer in college but never smoking dope; marijuana in the Fifties and early Sixties was the stuff of jazz musicians and hoodlums in faraway places.<br><br>Before I married the love of my life, my high school classmate Meredith, we had never spent a night together. In those days, parked cars and curfews were the defining limits of courtship.<br><br>We were married in 1962, when Meredith was twenty-one and I was twenty-two, in a traditional Episcopal church wedding with a reception at our hometown country club. We left the next day with all our worldly possessions, including the five table cigarette lighters we had received as wedding presents, in the backseat of the no-frills Chevrolet compact car her father had given us as a wedding present.<br><br>We were eager to see a wider world, but only one step at a time. California was still four years away. Our first stop was Omaha, Nebraska, which then was an unimaginative and conservative midsize city a half day&#x2019;s drive down the Missouri River from our hometown. We could barely afford ninety dollars a month to rent a furnished apartment, but when we went looking, in the stifling heat of a Great Plains August, I was dressed in a jacket and tie, and Meredith was wearing part of her honeymoon trousseau, including a girdle and hose. Five years later, I rarely wore a tie except on television, and Meredith was freed not only of girdles but also of hose and brassieres on California weekends.<br><br>In 1962, I had an entry-level reporter&#x2019;s job at an Omaha television station. I had bargained to get a salary of one hundred dollars a week, because I didn&#x2019;t feel I could tell Meredith&#x2019;s doctor father I was making less. Meredith, who had a superior college record, couldn&#x2019;t find any work because, as one personnel director after another told her, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a young bride. If we hire you, you&#x2019;ll just get pregnant before long and want maternity leave.&#x201d;<br><br>In retrospect, the political and cultural climate in the early Sixties seems both a time of innocence and also like a sultry, still summer day in the Midwest: an unsettling calm before a ferocious storm over Vietnam, which was not yet an American war. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was confronting racism in the South and getting a good deal of exposure on The Huntley-Brinkley Report on NBC and The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, the two primary network newscasts, each just fifteen minutes long.<br><br>In the fall of 1963, first CBS and then, shortly after, NBC expanded those signature news broadcasts to a half hour. As a sign of the importance of the expansion, Cronkite and Huntley and Brinkley were granted lengthy exclusive interviews with President Kennedy. ABC wouldn&#x2019;t be a player in the news major leagues until the 1970s, when Roone Arledge brought to ABC News the energy and programming approach he had applied to ABC Sports. Kennedy, America&#x2019;s first truly telegenic president, was a master of the medium, fully appreciating its power to reach into the living rooms of America from sea to shining sea.<br><br>During our time in Omaha, John F. Kennedy was not a local favorite. The city&#x2019;s deeply conservative culture remained immune to Kennedy&#x2019;s charms and to his arguments for social changes, such as civil rights and the introduction of government-subsidized medical care for the elderly. I&#x2019;m sure many of my conservative friends at the time thought I was a card short of being a member of the Communist Party because I regularly championed the need for enforced racial equality and Medicare.<br><br>One of the most popular speakers to come through Omaha in those days was a familiar figure from my childhood, when kids in small towns on the Great Plains spent Saturday afternoons in movie theaters watching westerns. Ronald Reagan looked just like he did on the big screen. He was kind of a local boy who had made good, starting out as a radio star next door in Iowa and moving on to Hollywood, before becoming a television fixture as host of General Electric Theater.<br><br>Reagan&#x2019;s Omaha appearances were part of his arrangement with GE, which allowed him to be an old-fashioned circuit-riding preacher, warning against the evils of big government and communism, while praising the virtues of big business and the free market. He was every inch a star, impeccably dressed and groomed. But those of us who shared his Midwestern roots were a bit surprised to find that although he was completely cordial, he was not noticeably warm. That part of his personality remained an enigma even to his closest friends and advisers throughout his historically successful political career.<br><br>In Omaha the only time he lightened up in my presence was when I noticed he was wearing contact lenses and I asked him about them. He got genuinely excited as he described how they were a new soft model, not like the hard ones that could irritate the eyes. He even wrote down the name of his California optometrist so Meredith could order a pair for herself. (Later, when he became president, I often thought, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not only a great politician, he&#x2019;s a helluva contact lens salesman.&#x201d;)<br><br>President Kennedy also passed through Omaha, but only for a brief stop at the Strategic Air Command headquarters there. In those days, SAC was an instantly recognized acronym because the bombers it comprised&#x2014;some of which we could see because they were always in the air ready to respond in case of an attack&#x2014;were a central component of America&#x2019;s Cold War military strategy.<br><br>More memorable for me was a visit to SAC by the president&#x2019;s brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The younger Kennedy was a striking contrast to the president, who had been smiling and chatty with the local press and even more impressive in person than on television. Unlike the president, who was always meticulously and elegantly dressed, the attorney general was wearing a rumpled suit, and the collar on his blue button-down shirt was frayed. He was plainly impatient, and his mood did not improve when I asked for a reaction to Alabama governor George Wallace&#x2019;s demand that JFK resign the presidency because of his stance on school desegregation. Bobby fixed those icy blue eyes on me and said, as if I were to blame for the governor&#x2019;s statement, &#x201c;I have no comment on anything Governor Wallace has to say.&#x201d;<br><br>I was on duty in the newsroom a few weeks later when the United Press International wire-service machine began to sound its bulletin bells. I walked over casually and began to read a series of sentences breaking in staccato fashion down the page:<br><br>three shots were fired at president kennedy&#x2019;s motorcade in downtown dallas . . . flash&#x2014;kennedy seriously wounded, perhaps fatally by assassin&#x2019;s bullet . . . president john f. kennedy died at approximately 1:00 pm (cst).<br><br>John F. Kennedy, the man I had thought would define the political ideal for the rest of my days, was suddenly gone in the senseless violence of a single moment. In ways we could not have known then, the gunshots in Dealey Plaza triggered a series of historic changes: the quagmire of Vietnam that led to the fall of Lyndon Johnson as president; the death of Robert Kennedy in pursuit of the presidency; and the comeback, presidency, and subsequent disgrace of Richard Nixon.<br><br>On that beautiful late autumn November morning, however, my immediate concern was to get this story on the air.

Robert Bly brings together a harvest of the prose poems he has been writing for more than thirty years, including a number of poems that have never appeared in book form. This collection of prose poems, drawn from work done over the past 30 years, is organized into five sections The Point Reyes Poems, Family Poems, Object and Creatures Glanced at Briefly, Love Poems, and Looking for the Rat&#39;s Hole.</p><p>Bly is a poet, translator, and author of the current best-selling Iron John ( LJ 11/15/90). This collection of prose poems, drawn from work done over the past 30 years, is organized into five sections: "The Point Reyes Poems," "Family Poems," "Object and Creatures Glanced at Briefly," "Love Poems," and "Looking for the Rat's Hole." In "The Dead Seal," Bly praises the seal's whiskers, smooth skin, and slanted eyes as if offering a prayer and asks the seal to "Be comfortable in death" as it had been in the ocean. The poems in "Objects and Creatures Glanced at Briefly" offer a fresh look at an oyster, a potato, a caterpillar, and a grain of rice, among other things. Bly often expresses delight in the delicate fabric of nature, as when he comments on a bird's "balanced, disciplined, airy . . . rows of feathers." These are not melancholy musings but joyous, inspired meditations that demonstrate Bly's talent for conveying in the simplest language the richness and complexity of the universe around us.<br><i>- Francis Poole, Univ. of Delaware Lib., Newark</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Spies, Scouts, and Raiders: Irregular Operations (Time-Life The Civil War)</h2><p>Describes the activities of spies and couriers during the Civil War, looks at acts of sabotage and guerrilla warfare, and offers profiles of leaders of special operations</p><p></p><h2>Otis (Dolly Parton&#39;s Imagination Library)</h2><p>very good story for young children.</p><p></p><h2>Big Book of Tractors (Big Books)</h2><p>Open the giant fold-out pages to discover some of the biggest and most amazing tractors ever built - from the world&#39;s largest tractor to huge harvesting machines and monster polar vehicles.</p><p></p><h2>Living in the Final Chapter</h2><p>The Bible indicates God has established specific times and seasons that unlock the mystery of prophetic time.

At the same time, he furthers his exploration of the role which warfare and its institutions play in social life by showing how each of the six armies, while resembling one another in purpose and authority, is a mirror of its own nation's values. Each army is shown at successive stages of the invasion in a battle sequence testing them to the utmost: the Americans in their terrifying night drop on the eve of landings, the Canadians at the Omaha beachhead, the English savagely fighting their way inland, the Germans in their surprisingly strong resistance, the Poles in exile desperately blocking the German escape route, and the French at last liberating their City of Light. This extraordinary book is a shining addition to the dramatic literature of men at war.</p><p>John Keegan's innovative approach to the invasion of Normandy correctly observes that the invasion, while colossal, was merely the beginning of a series of furious battles in northern France, and Keegan accordingly tackles not only the actions of June 6, 1944, but the subsequent Normandy campaigns by five Allied nations and their German opponents. Focusing on specific actions, such as the U.S. 101st Airborne night drop into France and the British infantry battles surrounding the city of Caen, he provides an exciting chronological account of the action in Normandy with considerable depth about tactical decisions.<p> Keegan is a skilled writer and his battle accounts are stirring. But beyond the vivid battle stories, this is also a book that will engage intellectually those who study battles and tactics, as well as the diplomatic activity that was necessary for the Allied victory in the Second World War's European theater of operations. <i>--Robert McNamara</i></p>JOHN KEEGAN is the defense editor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (London) and Britain's foremost military historian.

He's gone out ahead of our group to peer around the corner by the hardware store. From there you can see all of Jefferson High.<br><br>The gleaming redbrick walls run forty feet high. The building is a block wide, and the windowpanes are spotless. A heavy concrete arch hangs over the two-story wood-and-glass doors at the front entrance.<br><br>The only thing between us and the school is the parking lot. And the white people.<br><br>We've all walked past Jefferson a thousand times before, but this will be the first time any of us steps inside. Until today, those big wooden doors might as well have been triple-locked, and we didn't have the key.<br><br>Our school, on the other side of town, is only one story. It's narrow&#x2014;no wider than the Food Town. Our teachers put boards in the windows to cover the cracks in the glass, but that's not enough to stop the wind from whistling past us at our desks.<br><br>Our old school, anyway. Jefferson is supposed to be our school now.<br><br>If we can make it through those big brown doors.<br><br>"They're out there all right," Chuck says when he comes back. He's trying to smile, but he just looks frozen. "Somebody sent out the welcome committee."<br><br>No one laughs. We can hear the white people. They're shouting, but the sound is too disjointed for us to make out the words.<br><br>I'm glad. I don't want to hear. I don't want my little sister Ruth to hear it, either. I try to pull her closer to me, but she jerks away. Ruth will be fifteen in two weeks, and she already thinks she's too old to need help from her big sister.<br><br>"If anything happens, you come find me, all right?" I whisper. "Don't trust the teachers or the white people. Come straight to me."<br><br>"I can take care of myself," Ruth whispers back. She steps away from me and links arms with Yvonne, one of the other freshmen.<br><br>"What are you gonna do if they try something?" Chuck asks Ennis. He keeps his voice low, trying to blend in with the dull roar coming from the school, so the younger kids won't hear him. Chuck, Ennis and I are the only three seniors in our group. Most of the others are freshmen and sophomores. "They've got some big guys on that football team."<br><br>"Never mind that," Ennis says, raising his voice so the others can hear. "They won't try anything, not in school. All they'll do is call us names, and we'll just ignore them and keep walking. Isn't that right, Sarah?"<br><br>"That's right," I echo. I want to sound in charge, like Mrs. Mullins, but my voice wobbles.<br><br>Ennis holds my eye. His face looks like Daddy's did this morning, when he watched Ruth and me climb into the car-pool station wagon. Like he's taking a good, long look, in case he doesn't get another chance.<br><br>Ennis sounds like Daddy, too. My father and Mrs. Mullins and the rest of the NAACP leaders have been coaching us on the rules since the summer, when the court first said the school board had to let us into the white school. Rule One: Ignore anything the white people say to you and keep walking. Rule Two: Always sit at the front of the classroom, near the door, so you can make a quick getaway if you need to. And Rule Three: Stay together whenever you possibly can.<br><br>"What if they spit on us?" one of the freshmen boys whispers. The ten of us are walking so tightly together down the narrow sidewalk we can't help but hear each other now, but none of us makes any move to separate. "We're supposed to stand there and take it?"<br><br>"You take it unless you want to get something worse after school lets out," Chuck says.<br><br>There's a glint in Chuck's eye. I don't think he'll take anything he doesn't want to take.<br><br>I wonder what he thinks is going to happen today. I wonder if he's ready.<br><br>I thought I was. Now I'm not so sure.<br><br>"Listen up, everybody, this is important." Ennis sounds serious and official, like the NAACP men. "Remember what they told us. Look straight ahead and act like you don't hear the white people. If a teacher says something to you, you don't talk back. Don't let anybody get you alone in the bathroom or on the stairs. And no matter what happens, you just keep walking."<br><br>"What if somebody tries to hang us from the flagpole?" the freshman says. "Do we just keep walking then, too?"<br><br>"You watch your mouth," Chuck tells him. "You'll scare the girls."<br><br>I want to tell him the girls are plenty scared already.<br><br>Instead I straighten my shoulders and lift my head. The younger kids are watching me. I can't let them see how my stomach is dropping to my feet. How the fear is buzzing in my ear like a mosquito that won't be swatted away.<br><br>We round the corner. Across the street, Jefferson High School sweeps into view. The white people are spread out across the front steps and the massive parking lot. Now I know why we could hear the crowd so well. There must be hundreds of them. The whole student body, all standing there. Waiting.<br><br>"Just like I said," Chuck says. He lets out a low whistle. "Our very own personal welcome wagon."<br><br>Ahead of me, Ruth shivers, despite her bulky winter coat. Under it she's wearing her favorite blue plaid dress with the crinoline slip and brand-new saddle shoes. I'm in my best white blouse, starched stiff. Our hair is done so nice it might as well be Easter Sunday. Mama fixed it last night, heating the hot combs on the stove and yanking each strand smooth. Everything's topsy-turvy with school starting in February instead of September, but we're all in our best clothes anyway. No one wants the white people to think we can't afford things as nice as theirs.<br><br>I try to catch Chuck's eye, but he isn't paying attention to me. He's looking at the crowd.<br><br>They're watching us.<br><br>They're shouting.<br><br>Each new voice is sharper and angrier than the last.<br><br>I still can't make out what they're saying, but we're not far now.<br><br>I want to cover Ruth's ears. She'd never let me. Besides, she'll hear it soon enough no matter what I do.<br><br>Our group has gone quiet. The boys are done blustering. Ruth lets go of Yvonne and steps back toward me. Behind us, a girl hiccups.<br><br>What if one of them starts crying? If the white people see us in tears, they'll laugh. They'll think they've beaten us before we've begun. We have to look strong.<br><br>I close my eyes, take a long breath and recite in my clearest voice. <em>"The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want."</em><br><br>Ruth joins in. <em>"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters."</em><br><br>Then, all ten of us, in the same breath. <em>"He restoreth my soul."</em><br><br>Some of them have spotted us from across the street. The white boys at the front of the crowd are pushing past each other to get the first look at us.<br><br>Police officers line the school's sidewalks in front of the boys. They're watching us, too.<br><br>I don't bother looking back at them. The police aren't here to help us. Their shiny badges are all that's stopping them from yelling with the other white people. For all we know they trade in those badges for white sheets at night.<br><br>Then reporters are running toward us. A flashbulb goes off in my face. The heat singes my eyes. All I see is bright white pain.<br><br><em>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.</em><br><br>I want to reach for Ruth, but my hands are shaking. It's all I can do to hold on to my books.<br><br>"Are you afraid?" a reporter shouts, shoving a microphone at my chin. "If you succeed, you'll be the first Negroes to set foot in a white school in this state. What do you think will happen once you get inside?"<br><br>I step around him. Ruth is holding her head high. I lift mine, too.<br><br><em>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.</em><br><br>We're almost at the parking lot now. We can hear the shouts.<br><br>"Here come the niggers!" yells a boy on the steps. "The niggers are coming!"<br><br>The rest of the crowd takes up his chant, as if they rehearsed it. "The niggers! The niggers! The niggers!"<br><br>I try to take Ruth's hand. She shakes me away, but her shoulders are quivering.<br><br>I wish she wasn't here with us. I wish she didn't have to do this.<br><br>I wish I didn't have to do this.<br><br>I think about what the white reporter said. <em>If you succeed...</em><br><br>And if we don't?<br><br>"It will be all right," I tell Ruth.<br><br>But my words are drowned out in the shouting.<br><br>"Mau maus!"<br><br>"Tar babies!"<br><br>"Coons!"<br><br>And "nigger." Over and over.<br><br>"Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger! Nigger!"<br><br>I've never been called a nigger in my life. Not until today.<br><br>We step over the curb. The white people jostle us, bumping up against us, trying to shove us back. We keep pushing forward, slowly, but it's hard. The crowd isn't moving, so we have to slide between them. Ennis and Chuck go in front, clearing a path, ignoring the elbows to their sides and shoves at their chests.<br><br>I want to put Ruth behind me, but then I couldn't see her, and what if we got separated? What would I tell Mama and Daddy?<br><br>I grab her arm too tight, my fingers digging in. Ruth doesn't complain. She leans in closer to me.<br><br>"Go back to Africa!" someone shouts by my ear. "We don't want niggers in our school!"<br><br>Just walk. Get inside. Get Ruth inside. When the reporters go away everyone will calm down. If we can get through this part it will be all right.<br><br><em>My cup runneth over.</em><br><br>Ruth's arm jerks away from me. I almost fall, my legs swaying dangerously under me, but I catch myself before I collapse.<br><br>I turn toward Ruth, or where she should be. Three older boys, their backs to me, are standing around my little sister, towering over her. One of them steps close to her. Too close. He knocks the books out of her arms, into the dirt.<br><br>I lunge toward them, but Ennis is faster. He dodges through a gap between the boys&#x2014;he doesn't shove them; we're not allowed to touch any of them, no matter what they do to us&#x2014;and pulls Ruth back toward me, leaving her books where they fell. He nods at me in a way that almost makes me believe he's got everything under control.<br><br>He doesn't. He can't. If the boys do anything to him, Ennis doesn't stand a chance, not with three against one. But they let him go, snarling, "We're gonna make your life Hell, black boy."<br><br>Ruth's still holding her chin high, but she's shaking harder than ever. I wrap my hand back around her arm. My knuckles go pale. I swallow. Once, twice, three times. Enough to keep my eyes steady and my cheeks dry.<br><br>"What about my books?" Ruth asks me.<br><br>"We'll get you new books." The blood is rushing in my ears. I remember I should've thanked Ennis. I look for him, but he's surrounded by another group of white boys.<br><br>I can't help him. I can't stop walking.<br><br>Two girls, their faces all twisted up, start a new chant. <em>"Two, four, six, eight! We don't want to integrate!"</em><br><br>Others join in. The whole world is a sea of angry white faces and bright white flashbulbs. <em>"Two, four, six, eight! We don't want to&#x2014;"</em><br><br>"Is the NAACP paying you to go to school here?" a reporter shouts. "Why are you doing this?"<br><br>A girl pushes past the reporter to yell in my ear. Her voice is so shrill I'm sure my eardrum will burst. "Niggers go home! Dirty niggers go home!"<br><br>Ennis is back in front, pushing through the crowd with Chuck. Ennis is very tall, so he's easy to spot. People always ask if he plays basketball. He hates it because he's terrible at basketball. He's the best player on the football and baseball teams, though.<br><br>He was at our old school, anyway. That's all done now that he's coming to Jefferson. No sports for the boys, no choir for me, no cheerleading for Ruth. No dances or plays for any of us. No extracurriculars, that's what Mrs. Mullins said, not this year.<br><br>Something flies through the air toward Ennis. I shout for him to duck, but I'm too late. Whatever it is bounces off his head. Ennis keeps moving like he didn't even feel it.<br><br>I look for the police. They're standing on the curb, watching us. One sees me looking and points toward the main entrance. Telling me to keep moving.<br><br>He's looking right at us. He must have seen Ennis get hit.<br><br>He doesn't care. None of them do.<br><br>I bet they'd care if we threw things back.<br><br>"Nigger!" The girl is still shrieking at me. "Nigger! Nigger! You're nothing but a filthy, stinking nigger!"<br><br>We're almost there. The door is only a few yards away, but the crowd of white people in front of it is too thick. And the shouts are getting louder.<br><br>We'll never make it. We were stupid to think this could ever work.<br><br>I wonder if they knew that. The police. The judge. Mrs. Mullins. Daddy. Mama. Did they think we'd even get this far? Did they think this was enough?<br><br>Maybe next year. Maybe the year after that. Someday, they'll let us through, but not today.<br><br>Please, God, let this be over.<br><br>Someone shrieks behind me. I glance back.<br><br>Yvonne is clutching her neck. I can't tell if she's bleeding.<br><br>"Yvonne!" Ruth tries to turn back, but I hold her arm. We can worry about Yvonne later.<br><br>"Nigger!" The white girl at my shoulder is so close I can feel her hot breath on my face. "Coon digger! Stinking nigger!"<br><br>"Oh!" Ruth stumbles. I reach to catch her before she falls, but she finds her footing quickly. She's wiping something off her face.<br><br>The boy who spat on her is grinning. I want to hit him, hard, shove him back into the group of boys behind him. See how he likes it when he's not the one with the power.<br><br>Instead I keep walking, propelling my sister forward. We're inching closer to the doors.<br><br>We're not so far now. Maybe we can get inside. Inside, it will be better.<br><br>"You know you ain't going in there, nigger!" the girl screeches in my ear. "You turn around and go home if you know what's good for you! We don't want no niggers in our school!"<br><br>Ennis and Chuck are on the steps, almost at the front entrance. The doors are propped open. Behind them more white students are yelling and jostling. Two boys in letter-man's sweaters have their fists raised.<br><br>We just have to get past them. Inside the school, the teachers will keep everyone under control. The people who are shouting will start acting like regular people again. The entire school can't be made up of monsters.<br><br>Chuck and Ennis have stopped to wait for the others to catch up. Ruth and I are right behind them, so we stop, too.<br><br>Now that we're not moving, the crowd around us gets even thicker. The shouts get louder. The girl who's been following me has been joined by two of her friends.<br><br>"Who's that other nigger girl, huh?" she yells. "Is that your baby sister? Your tar baby sister?"<br><br>The girls screech in laughter. Ruth looks straight ahead, but her chin isn't quite as high anymore.<br><br>I want to take Daddy's pocketknife and slice the white girl's tongue in two.<br><br>"Keep the niggers out!" A group of boys chants in the doorway...</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2><p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</p><p>It's hard to fall in love with an earnest, appealing young hero like Harry Potter and then to watch helplessly as he steps into terrible danger! And in J.K. Rowling's <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>, the much anticipated sequel to the award-winning <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, he is in terrible danger indeed. As if it's not bad enough that after a long summer with the horrid Dursleys he is thwarted in his attempts to hop the train to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his second year. But when his only transportation option is a magical flying car, it is just his luck to crash into a valuable (but clearly vexed) Whomping Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. <p> Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, "The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware." But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny. Once again, Rowling writes with a combination of wit, whimsy, and a touch of the macabre that will leave readers young and old desperate for the next installment. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.<br><br>And strike is does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageous stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.<br><br>But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?</p><h2>The Crucified God: The Cross of Christ As the Foundation and Criticism of Christian Theology</h2><p>346p paperback, cover in very good condition, clean text, firm binding, a very good copy</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Germana book that would be of great assistance in university and college teaching, as well as providing a useful reference work for students, clergy and teachers</p><h2>The Druid Queen (Forgotten Realms: the Druidhome Trilogy)</h2><p>In the final volume of this trilogy, the Kendrick family continues to rule the Moonshae Isles, but the era of peace is threatened by unseen forces.

So begins <i>John Pig's Halloween</i>, Jan L. Waldron and illustrator David McPhail's monster-rich holiday alternative to the popular <i>Angel Pig and the Hidden Christmas</i>. John Pig, curled up in the shadows as his buddies don towering chapeaus and tangerine bows, tells his fellow pigs he is too tired to go trick-or-treating. The truth is, he's too scared. As the "gussied-up piggies all bid John adieu," he resigns himself to a long, lonely night of sulky pumpkin carving. A "Kaboom!!!" jolts John from his reverie, however, as an actual broomstick-riding, treat-seeking witch-pig crashes into the house. Disgusted with John Pig's trick-or-treat offerings of red licorice ribbons and rock candy, she hastily enlists the bewildered piglet in a pie-baking, cookie-making frenzy. The resulting aromas lure the witch's ghoulish friends from far and wide for a veritable monster mash of howling, slurping, waltzing, and oozing. Of course, they disappear out the back door as John's friends come in through the front: "John's housemates returned with stuffed bags and cold toes, / With Popsicle noses and lopsided bows. / 'Poor John,' they all sighed. 'He has <i>really</i> missed out. / 'He's skipped Halloween and been lonely, no doubt.'" Ha! This warm, richly illustrated book is perfect for the child who revels in the delicious creepiness of Halloween... but not <i>too</i> much. (Ages 4 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>Ages 4^-6. For the many kids who don't want to dress up in a costume on Halloween, here's a book about a little pig who stays home. Spooked by his Halloween fears, John won't join his siblings trick-or-treating. He's home alone when a friendly, rather bossy witch and her cat appear at the window. She enlists John to prepare a feast for her monster friends, who arrive to party through the evening. Surprised to find himself enjoying his guests, John finds that time flies. Finally, he bids them good night, and welcomes his brothers and sisters home for a second celebration. The story is written in rhymed couplets that scan well and keep the momentum of the story going. McPhail's ink-and-watercolor illustrations will grab children's attention from the first page, in which John Pig cowers in the shadow of an armchair, to the last, in which he nestles all snug in his bed--while out the window the witch and her cat fly away.

He fled to London, where he took to the radio to address his compatriots back home. &#x201c;Whatever happens,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the flame of French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished.&#x201d; At that moment, Charles de Gaulle entered history.</p><p>For the rest of the war, de Gaulle insisted he and his Free French movement were the true embodiment of France. Through sheer force of personality he inspired French men and women to risk their lives to resist the Nazi occupation. Sometimes aloof but confident in his leadership, he quarreled violently with Churchill and Roosevelt. Yet they knew they would need his help to rebuild a shattered Europe. Thanks to de Gaulle, France was recognized as one of the victorious Allies when Germany was finally defeated. Then, as President of the Fifth Republic, he brought France to the brink of a civil war over his controversial decision to pull out of Algeria. He challenged American hegemony, took France out of NATO, and twice vetoed British entry into the European Community in his pursuit of what he called &#x201c;a certain idea of France.&#x201d;</p><p>Julian Jackson&#x2019;s magnificent biography, the first major reconsideration in over twenty years, captures this titanic figure as never before. Drawing on the extensive resources of the recently opened de Gaulle archives, Jackson reveals the conservative roots of de Gaulle&#x2019;s intellectual formation, sheds new light on his relationship with Churchill, and shows how he confronted riots at home and violent independence movements from the Middle East to Vietnam. No previous biography has so vividly depicted this towering figure whose legacy remains deeply contested.</p></p><p>Julian Jackson is Professor of History at Queen Mary University of London and one of the foremost experts on twentieth-century France.

Murphy</b>&nbsp;is a US Army veteran of the Vietnam War. He is the author of a three-volume series on Medal of Honor recipients&#x2014;<i>Heroes of WWII</i>,<i>&nbsp;Korean War Heroes</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Vietnam Medal of Honor Heroes&#x2014;</i>as well two highly acclaimed Vietnam War histories&#x2014;<i>Dak To</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Semper Fi: Vietnam</i>. He lives in Mesa, Arizona.Instead of fighting Communist insurgents in Vietnam using their own guerrilla tactics, General Westmoreland chose to employ conventional means, hoping that attrition would wear down the enemy's will. In June 1967 he sent the 173d Airborne to a Central Highlands mountain hamlet named Dak To. At the outset, an entire U.S. company had over half its number killed in ambush, and fighting continued until many Americans died for ground that was soon abandoned. Military historian Murphy's workmanlike account of Dak To is well detailed, though not as gritty or compelling as Eric Hammel's oral histories (e.g., Lima-6 , LJ 11/15/89). And though the author provides an ample overview of where the battle fits in the greater scheme, the late Brig. Gen. S.L.A. Marshall, for one, bettered him in books like West to Cambodia ( LJ 12/15/68), giving greater insight into the military mind. Nonetheless, this work is recommended for libraries with large Vietnam War collections.<br><i>- Richard Paul Snyder, Cty. of Los Angeles P.

Widely praised by reviewers for his ability to describe common family problems, he is best loved by children for his freeflowing humor and gentle characters.Readers may be somewhat mystified by this latest installment in the saga of Lyle the lovable Crocodile, who lives with the Primm family on Manhattan's Upper East Side. In Waber's convoluted tale, clear narrative is sacrificed in the name of playful atmosphere. Lyle's mother Felicity has journeyed from the Land of Crocodile to join Lyle; they are happiest by day, when it is "just the two of them doing their chores." In the pivotal episode, Mrs. Primm takes Felicity shopping at a department store. Felicity, who innocently stocks her shopping bag with perfume bottles, lands in jail. Sentenced by a lenient judge to perform community service, Felicity gets the necessary training to care for the Primm's new baby. The story is carried on the strength of the warm illustrations, rendered in blotted ink line and soft watercolor washes. Whether this is a story of naturalization or cultural inculcation is unclear and perhaps unimportant, when irresistible scenes include one of Lyle, mirror in hand, practicing his best crooked-grin grimaces.

Ronald Rolheiser, O.M.I., Longing for the Holy: Spirituality for Everyday Life is for those who want to enrich their sense of the presence of God and develop a deeper spirituality. It concerns the way we channel the deep longing at the core of our beings and explores the implications of the central mysteries of faith-the Incarnation, the Eucharist, and the Paschal Mystery-for spirituality. Attending to the cultural challenges that keep us from realizing our true desire, it considers the important themes of church community, justice, sexuality, the practices of the spiritual life, and being a mystic of the everyday. &#34;We need someone to name the essentials. The Holy Longing tries to do that and Longing for the Holy: Spirituality for Everyday Life is a huge help in highlighting those essentials and making suggestions as to how we might integrate them more into our lives.&#34; Fr.

His <i>Sounds</i> (<i>Kl�nge</i>) of 1912 is one of the earliest, most beautiful examples of a 20th-century artist&#x2019;s book. Its &#x201c;sound poems&#x201d; are alternately narrative and expressive, witty and simple in form. They treat questions of space, color, physical design, and the act of seeing in a world that offers multiple and often contradictory possibilities. The woodcut illustrations that accompany the poems range from representational designs to abstract vignettes. In its fusion of image and word, <i>Sounds</i> epitomizes the artist&#x2019;s move toward abstraction and his aspiration to a synthesis of the arts. This updated edition of <i>Sounds</i> includes all of the book&#x2019;s poems in English and German and its woodcuts, twelve of which appear in color for greater fidelity to the original. The translator&#x2019;s introduction offers close formal examination of the poems and situates <i>Sounds</i> in the context of Kandinsky&#x2019;s oeuvre. Although it was prized by prominent 20th-century artists, <i>Sounds</i> is one of the least known of Kandinsky&#x2019;s major writings, and this remains the most authoritative English version.</p><p>Now in an updated English edition with full color illustrations, Kandinsky&#x2019;s fascinating and witty artist's book represents a crucial moment in the painter&#x2019;s move toward abstraction.<p><b>Wassily Kandinsky</b> was a Russian painter and art theorist, author of <i>Concerning the Spiritual in Art</i> (1912) and <i>Point to Line and Plane</i> (1926). <b>Elizabeth R.

Now, after more than a decade of tending to small children on a failing farm, oppressed by poverty, isolation and her husband's antagonistic family, she has mitigated her boredom by surrendering to an obsessive flirtation with a handsome younger man.</p><p>In the opening scene, Dellarobia is headed for a secluded mountain cabin to meet this man and initiate what she expects will be a self-destructive affair. But the tryst never happens. Instead, she walks into something on the mountainside she cannot explain or understand: a forested valley filled with silent red fire that appears to her a miracle.</p><p>After years lived entirely in the confines of one small house, Dellarobia finds her path suddenly opening out, chapter by chapter, into blunt and confrontational engagement with her family, her church, her town, her continent, and finally the world at large.</p></p><p><b>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2012:</b> In what may be the first novel to realistically imagine the near-term impact of &#x201c;global weirding,&#x201d; Barbara Kingsolver sets her latest story in rural Appalachia . In fictional Feathertown, Tennessee, Dellarobia Turnbow--on the run from her stifling life--charges up the mountain above her husband&#x2019;s family farm and stumbles onto a &#x201c;valley of fire&#x201d; filled with millions of monarch butterflies. This vision is deemed miraculous by the town&#x2019;s parishioners, then the international media. But when Ovid, a scientist who studies monarch behavior, sets up a lab on the Turnbow farm, he learns that the butterflies&#x2019; presence signals systemic disorder--and Dellarobia's in-laws&#x2019; logging plans won&#x2019;t help. Readers who bristle at politics made personal may be turned off by the strength of Kingsolver&#x2019;s convictions, but she never reduces her characters to mouthpieces, giving equal weight to climate science and human need, to forces both biological and biblical. Her concept of family encompasses all living beings, however ephemeral, and <i>Flight Behavior</i> gracefully, urgently contributes to the dialogue of survival on this swiftly tilting planet. --<i>Mari Malcolm</i><p><em>New York Times</em> Notable Book</p><p><em>Washington Post</em></p><p>Best Book Of The Year</p><p>Amazon's Top 100: Editor's Choice</p><p><em>Usa Today</em> Best Book Of The Year</p><p>Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen.

Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor?

Muth's photorealistic illustrations paved the way for the acceptance of painted comics, influencing a generation of artists who followed him.<br><br>Long out of print, these four issues are collected together for the first time as a hardcover graphic novel.</p><p>Jon J Muth&#x2019;s watercolor art has been called quietly life-changing&#x201d; by the <i>New York Times</i>. He is the author and artist of <i>The Three Questions</i> and the bestselling picture book <i>Zen Shorts</i>, as well as <i>A Family of Poems</i> by Caroline Kennedy, which was a national bestseller. Other works include the graphic novel <i>Moonshadow</i>, and the recently published <i>A Family Christmas</i>. He lives in New York.<br>Starred Review. Long before Criterion DVDs or the Independent Film Channel&#x2014;which is to say, in 1990&#x2014;painter Muth adapted Fritz Lang's classic serial killer tale <i>M</i> into a four-part comics miniseries. He hewed closely to Lang's original German script, employing a painterly, photorealistic style that evoked the grainy, tinted footage of early talkies. The result, more influential than popular in an era of rampant speculation and chromium covers, was undeniably gorgeous. Eighteen years later, after popular artists like Alex Ross have cited Muth as a major influence, Abrams has re-released <i>M</i> as a hardcover graphic novel, and the deluxe treatment only adds luster to the project. Lang's story&#x2014;an unidentified serial killer stalks children in a small German city&#x2014;is simple but compelling, allowing Muth's masterful technique to shine through. The watercolors are primarily sepia-toned, with occasional splashes of color for emphasis, giving the project a surreal, dreamlike quality that serves to heighten suspense. Muth's layouts are excellent, creating mise-en-sc�nes that evoke Lang without copying him, and his figures' acting (body language and facial expressions) also serves both story and mood. An informative afterword lets readers hear from Muth about technique and why he would even try to remake Lang: to see what he could learn. Readers will find it an impressive lesson. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Years before nano&#x201d; entered the vernacular as an abbreviation for nanotechnology&#x201d; which essentially means less is more&#x201d; rather than the bigger, the better&#x201d; Rav Berg was speaking and writing about this scientific concept in spiritual terms. And although the concept that less physicality can produce more power was only a recent discovery by scientists, it&#x2019;s something that Kabbalists have known throughout the ages. In his first new book in many years, Berg examines this idea in depth. He contends that space will continue to shrink until there is nothing between humans and the world around them, lending support to the notion that we are all one&#x201d; and by extension, to the credo love thy neighbor as thyself.&#x201d;</p><p>Rav Berg was born August 20, 1927, in New York City. After many years of traditional religious study, he was ordained as a rabbi at Torah VaDaat. A businessman who wanted to make a difference in this world, he was always searching for his true path. Upon a chance meeting with Rav Yehuda Brandwein, Rav Berg knew he had found his teacher, and moved to Israel to study with Rav Brandwein at The Kabbalah Centre. After he returned to New York, Rav Berg maintained a written correspondence with Rav Brandwein who passed on his legacy as director of The Kabbalah Centre to Rav Berg. <p> Rav Berg made it his mission to continue editing, writing, printing, and distributing all that he learned from his teacher and began sharing the secrets of Kabbalah texts, which historically had been reserved for scholars. His book, Kabbalah for the Layman, was the revolutionary step that made Kabbalah accessible to every person. Rav Berg s other books include The Kabbalah Connection, Wheels of a Soul: Kabbalah and Reincarnation, To the Power of One, Energy of the Hebrew Letters, Immortality, Nano, The Kabbalah Method, Taming Chaos, and Education of a Kabbalist. </p><p> Together with his wife, Karen, Rav Berg opened the doors of The Kabbalah Centre to all who desire to learn this universal wisdom. Following Rav Berg's passing in September 2013, Karen Berg, the spiritual leader of The Kabbalah Centre, continues their work and vision with their son and co-director, Michael Berg.</p></p><h2>Knitting Yarns: Writers on Knitting</h2><p><p><strong>A collection of poignant essays about the transformative power of knitting by twenty-seven extraordinary writers.</strong></p> &#x201c;The impressive collection of writers here have contributed essays that celebrate knitting and knitters. They share their knitting triumphs and disasters as well as their life triumphs and disasters. . . . These essays will break your heart. They will have you laughing out loud.&#x201d;&#x2015;Ann Hood, from the introduction <p>Why does knitting occupy a place in the hearts of so many writers? What&#x2019;s so magical and transformative about yarn and needles? How does knitting help us get through life-changing events and inspire joy? In <em>Knitting Yarns</em>, twenty-seven writers tell stories about how knitting healed, challenged, or helped them to grow. Barbara Kingsolver describes sheering a sheep for yarn. Elizabeth Berg writes about her frustration at failing to knit. Ann Patchett traces her life through her knitting, writing about the scarf that knits together the women she&#x2019;s loved and lost. Knitting a Christmas gift for his blind aunt helped Andre Dubus III knit an understanding with his girlfriend. Kaylie Jones finds the woman who used knitting to help raise her in France and heals old wounds. Sue Grafton writes about her passion for knitting. Also included are five original knitting patterns created by Helen Bingham.</p><p>Poignant, funny, and moving, <em>Knitting Yarns</em> is sure to delight knitting enthusiasts and lovers of literature alike.</p></p><p>Ann Hood is the author of eight previous books, including the best-selling memoir Comfort: A Journey Through Grief and best-selling novels The Book That Matters Most and The Knitting Circle. She lives in Providence, Rhode Island.This is a collection of essays and one poem by well-known authors about the magical powers of knitting. The book also includes six knitting patterns interspersed throughout the book. Because the focus of the text is on the act of knitting and the feelings evoked rather than the finished product, there are no images or diagrams to accompany the knitting projects. Rather, the text invites the reader to curl up with a book or with knitting and be transported to a world of healing, peace, and calm. These are deeply personal stories ranging from true and heartbreaking (Martha Frankel attempting to keep her friend from joining a cult through knitting), to the honest and humorous (finger knitting being even more relaxing than knitting because you can drink your martini while finger knitting). This book makes you want to start knitting or resurrect an old knitting project. --Rebecca Pfenning</p><h2>Ismaelillo: versos libres, versos sencillos</h2><p>Presents works by the 19th-century Cuban poet and nationalist leader.</p><p>Text: Spanish</p><h2>Creative Advertising, New Edition</h2><p><p><strong>"More than just a nice-to-look-at, easy-to-flip-through book...Pricken has loftier goals&#x2015;namely, to transform readers into top creatives by introducing them to a variety of techniques and ideas."&#x2015;<em>Adweek</em></strong></p> Unraveling the creative process behind some of the most effective campaigns of recent years, Mario Pricken showcases over two hundred examples of international advertising from a wide range of media, including magazines, billboards, television, movies, and the Internet.

The essays, initially published in the English periodical The Nineteenth Century between 1890 and 1896, explore the role of mutually-beneficial cooperation and reciprocity (or &#34;mutual aid&#34;) in the animal kingdom and human societies both past and present. It is an argument against the competition-centred theories of so-called social Darwinism, as well as the romantic depictions of cooperation presented by writers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who argued it was motivated by universal love rather than self-interest. Mutual Aid is considered a fundamental text in anarchist communism, presenting a scientific basis for communism alternative to the historical materialism of the Marxists. Many biologists also consider it an important catalyst in the scientific study of cooperation.</p><p>Prince Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin was a Russian zoologist, evolutionary theorist, philosopher, scientist, revolutionary, philologist, economist, activist, geographer, writer, and prominent anarchist. Kropotkin advocated a communist society free from central government and based on voluntary associations between workers. He wrote many books, pamphlets and articles, the most prominent being The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops, and his principal scientific offering, Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution. He also contributed the article on anarchism to the Encyclop�dia Britannica Eleventh Edition.</p><h2>When One Religion Isn&#39;t Enough: The Lives of Spiritually Fluid People</h2><p><b>An exploration into the lives of people who embrace two or more religious traditions, and what this growing community tells us about change in our society</b><br><br><b>Named a best book of 2018 by <i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>In the United States, we often assume religious and spiritual identity are pure, static, and singular. But some people regularly cross religious boundaries. These &#x201c;spiritually fluid&#x201d; people celebrate complex religious bonds, and in the process they blur social categories, evoke prejudice, and complicate religious communities. Their presence sparks questions: How and why do people become spiritually fluid? Are they just confused or unable to commit? How do we make sense of them?<br><br><i>When One Religion Isn&#x2019;t Enough</i> explores the lives of spiritually fluid people, revealing that while some chose multiple religious belonging, many more inherit it. For many North Americans, the complicated legacies of colonialism are part of their family story, and they may consider themselves both Christian and Hindu, or Buddhist, or Yoruban, or one of the many other religions native to colonized lands.<br><br>For some Asian Americans, singular religious identity may seem an alien concept, as many East Asian nations freely mix Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist, and other traditions. Some African American Christians are consciously seeking to reconnect with ancestral spiritualities. And still other people are born into religiously mixed families. Jewish-Christian intermarriage led the way in the US, but religious diversity here is only increasing: almost four in ten Americans (39 percent) who have married since 2010 have a spouse who is in a different religious group.<br><br>Through in-depth conversations with spiritually fluid people, renowned scholar Duane Bidwell explores how people come to claim and be claimed by multiple religious traditions, how spiritually fluid people engage radically opposed truth claims, and what this growing population tells us about change within our communities.</p><p><b>Duane R. Bidwell, PhD</b>, is professor of practical theology, spiritual care, and counseling at Claremont School of Theology, Claremont, California. A clinical fellow of the American Association of Pastoral Counselors, Duane has been a chaplain, pastor, counselor, and nonprofit director. Currently, he sits on the board of the Taos Institute and maintains a small clinical practice at the Clinebell Institute for Pastoral Counseling and Psychotherapy in Claremont. Both Buddhist and Christian, he lives in California with his wife, son, and dog.&#x201c;Will appeal to spiritual readers seeking an understanding and affirmation of the growing multireligious movement. Strongly recommended for libraries of all types.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>, Starred Review<br><br>&#x201c;The book operates with great sensitivity and awareness, addressing the difference between spiritual fluidity and spiritual bypassing or cultural appropriation . . . inspiring reading for anyone interested in enlivened spirituality or seeking permission to embrace their complexities.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Foreword Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;This groundbreaking book is essential for anyone who wants to understand the contemporary religious landscape. Duane Bidwell&#x2019;s work will now become a touchstone for academics, clergy, therapists, journalists, and all of us who participate in more than one religion. Bidwell offers up richly detailed personal stories told with great sensitivity. In telling these stories, this book documents spiritual fluidity as transgressive yet also life-giving, and as important and surprisingly common rather than marginal and exceptional.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Susan Katz Miller, author of <i>Being Both</i><br><br>&#x201c;Amid the growing academic, and often dissonant, conversations about multiple religious belonging, Duane Bidwell offers a fresh and clarifying voice. He invites &#x2018;spiritually fluid people&#x2019; to speak for themselves. His analysis follows, and is subordinate to, a careful listening to them&#x2014;and it results in new insights into what multiple belonging feels like, how it happens, and the difference it can make in one&#x2019;s life. Highly recommended for both academics and seekers.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Paul F. Knitter, author of <i>Without Buddha I Could Not Be a Christian</i><br><br>&#x201c;For all those who deeply long for an abundant life, and who know such thirst cannot be quenched by the constraints of religious monogamy, this book is a must-read. <i>When One Religion Isn&#x2019;t Enough</i> speaks not only to those who deeply consider the sociopolitical ramifications of religious openness but to those who feel that being religiously faithful and spiritually deep can mean being open to more than just one religion.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Isabelle Noth, professor for spiritual care, psychology of religion, and religious education, University of Bern, Switzerland<br><br>&#x201c;In this sharply insightful and refreshingly readable work, Bidwell takes us on an absorbing journey into the rapidly expanding world of religious fluidity. Simultaneously, he provides support and guidance to those embarked on this journey, while illuminating the rich potentials. In these times of increasingly fluid identities, the implications are legion.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kenneth J. Gergen, author of <i>Relational Being: Beyond Self and Community</i><br><br>&#x201c;Bidwell, who is himself Buddhist-Christian, weaves tenderly crafted narratives and exercises the disciplines of silence and attention, practices that both traditions recognize as holy, in order to listen carefully to those who live with multiple religious belonging. The result: you cannot dismiss what elicits respect and even reverence. He shows that spiritually fluid lives may not have the intellectual consistency required by certain elite theologians fixated on doctrinal consistency, but these are nonetheless deeply considered lives marked by profound faithfulness and integrity. This learned book is the product of decades of intimate living with and listening to the religiously multiple; no one interested in the subject can afford to ignore it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;John Thatamanil, author of <i>The Immanent Divine: God, Creation, and the Human Predicament</i><br><br>&#x201c;Exploring religious multiplicity through the prism of experience, Duane Bidwell breaks fresh ground in this landmark work. Deeply attentive to the interstitial spaces in which religious multiplicity is shaped, the rarity of this book lies in the intricate, intimate, and insightful manner in which Bidwell captures the interplay of the sacred, the social, the familial, and the cultural in the lives of those who embody religious multiplicity. Outstanding and indispensable, this is a book that all those interested in the study of religion cannot afford to bypass.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Rev.

The book assumes no prior painting experience, opening with the essentials: materials, making marks, mixing color, understanding foreground and distance, and making objects look three-dimensional. Step-by-step exercises show how to paint separate features of pictures-plants, flowers, trees, skies, stones, water-then how to combine them into finished paintings.</p><p>Marie Blake is an experienced professional pastel artist who has had years of experience teaching beginning art students of all ages and skill levels.I worry when I see books claiming categorically that everyone can be taught to paint. These two books confidently insist that the "absolute" beginner can produce pastels and watercolors in no time. In Blake's attempt to prove this, she sensibly points out that pastels can be seen as crayons for adults no messy oils, tubes, and brushes to deal with. She takes the student from simple marks on a page through tone, perspective, and so forth to simple still lifes, landscapes, and figures. Despite initial doubts, Blake does deliver in this volume, and for those on a budget, it's less than half the price of Jackie Simmonds's more comprehensive Pastel Workbook: A Complete Course in Ten Lessons (LJ 11/15/99). With an identical format and purpose, Crawshaw takes on watercolor for the beginner. Starting with a basic flat wash, he advances to simple fruits and flowers, people and buildings. Unlike Blake, he skips certain drawing fundamentals. Nevertheless, this delightful little book will complement Mary Whyte's Watercolor for the Serious Beginner (LJ 3/15/98). Both step-by-step guides for the absolute beginner are recommended, especially for libraries on limited budgets. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Noguchi Museum - A Portrait, by Tina Barney and Stephen Shore</h2><p><p><strong>The celebrated New York museum captured by two of today's most respected photographers, Tina Barney and Stephen Shore.</strong></p><p><em>The Noguchi Museum</em> provides a unique perspective on the artwork of Isamu Noguchi and its setting in the Noguchi Museum through the eyes of renowned photographers Stephen Shore and Tina Barney. Noguchi, a modernist sculptor and designer, founded and designed the museum for the specific purpose of exhibiting his works. The 1920s-era industrial space in Long Island City, Queens, thus became the first and only museum in the US to be designed by a living artist for the artist's own work.</p><p>Shore has photographed individual works on view at the museum, documenting them in new and surprising ways; and Barney has photographed visitors at the museum and its events, capturing something of the spatial experience of the museum.

In 1971 Shore became the first living photographer to have a solo exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

The Cornish Foundation is thriving under the directorship of Arthur Cornish when Arthur and his beguiling wife, Maria Theotoky, decide to undertake a project worthy of Francis Cornish -- connoisseur, collector, and notable eccentric -- whose vast fortune endows the Foundation. The grumpy, grimy, extraordinarily talented music student Hulda Schnakenburg is commissioned to complete E. T .A.

Hoffmann&#x2019;s dictum, "the lyre of Orpheus opens the door of the underworld," seems to be all too true -- especially when the long-hidden secrets of Francis Cornish himself are finally revealed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Baroque and deliciously funny, this third book in The Cornish Trilogy shows Robertson Davies at his very considerable best.<br><br>"Robertson Davies is the sort of novelist readers can hardly wait to tell their friends about." -- <i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>Robertson Davies (1913-1995) had three successive careers during the time he became an internationally acclaimed author: actor, publisher, and, finally, professor at the University of Toronto. The author of twelve novels and several volumes of essays and plays, he was the first Canadian to be inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.No other Canadian novelist is lauded and read as widely outside his homeland as Robertson Davies. His characters fascinate, and his gentle, graceful style makes no demands on the reader. His civilized prose should read well aloud--indeed, Davidson helps one hear its strengths. He provides an intelligent, expressive, well-paced rendering of the narrative about a Canadian university professor, as well as vivid impersonations of the characters. However, he has trouble with the &#34;authorial voice.&#34; In his mouth, the narrative has a sarcastic, even cynical, edge, whereas Davies&#39;s words, though not without humor and irony, are far more empathetic. Y.R. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Seven Songs of Merlin (Merlin Saga)</h2><p>Young Merlin, triumphant after his first encounter with the dreaded Rhita Gawr, has brought new hope to Fincayra, the enchanted isle that lies between earth and sky. Yet when a renewed tide of evil arises, its first victim is Merlin's own mother. To save her, Merlin and the forest girl Rhia must follow the perilous path of Seven Songs of Wizardry that has claimed even the lives of great wizards. Most difficult of all, Merlin must discover the secret of seeing not with his eyes, but with his heart.The eagerly anticipated second book in <i>The Lost Years of Merlin</i> epic combines all the passion, power, and spiritual depth that are T.A. Barron's hallmarks. It adds a thrilling new dimension to the legend of Merlin, even as it offers lasting inspiration to us all.</p><p>For me, writing is exploring. Whether it's the surprising connections among people, the wondrous patterns of nature, or the mysterious wellsprings of the spirit-the universe beckons. I love to explore it, whether by foot or by pen. <p>Writing is both the most joyous-and most agonizing-labor I know. And it is by far the best way to travel-in our world or any other. Ever since my youth on a ranch in Colorado, I've felt passionate about nature-and about writing. I wrote and published my own magazine as a kid, called the Idiot's Odyssey, which sold about five copies an issue (including the ones my parents bought). I kept writing during my college years at Princeton, and during my years at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. During that time at Oxford, I composed stories and poems while hiking in the Scottish highlands, while sitting beneath the boughs of an English oak I named Merlin's tree, while backpacking through Asia, Africa, and the Arctic; and while participating in a traditional roof thatching in Japan. Even during my years managing a fast-growing business in New York City, I often rose before dawn to write. </p><p>Finally, I followed my dream to write full time. In 1990, I moved back to Colorado and started writing in the attic of my home, with the help of my wife and our five young children. </p><p>My five-book epic about Merlin's youth gives me a chance to add a new dimension to the rich lore about this enduring figure. Why am I spending almost a decade writing about Merlin? Because he is much, much more than a great wizard. His story is, in truth, a metaphor-for the idea that all of us, no matter how weak or confused, have a magical person down inside-waiting to be discovered.

And even more difficult for the young wizard, he must discover the secret of seeing- not with his eyes but with his heart.</p><h2>On Persephone&#39;s Island: A Sicilian Journal</h2><p>An American woman residing in Sicily for the past twenty years portrays the Sicilian landscape and customs--both rural and urban--from the perspectives of both a &#34;foreigner&#34; and a resident.</p><p>Mary Taylor Simeti arrived in Sicily in 1962 to do volunteer work. Freshly graduated from Radcliffe College after growing up in a distinguished and privileged New York City family, the last thing she expected was to fall in love and marry a Sicilian. <i>On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal</i> is the ambivalent love story of an intelligent, complex, and self-reflective woman. The book recounts the events of 1983, the year Simeti turned 42. Her narrative alternates between Palermo, where her children attend school and her husband Toninno is a professor of agricultural economy, and Bosco, in eastern Sicily, where she shoulders demanding responsibilities on the working farm that has belonged to her husband's family for three generations. <p> Simeti feels the isolation of being an expatriate and outsider, although she claims to welcome this perspective when faced with frustration and disgust at the pervading political corruption and corrosive effects of the Mafia on everyday life. Despite her natural diffidence, she shares personal insights that make<i>On Persephone's Island</i> as compelling as her prose. Simeti intersperses rich helpings of Sicilian history and culture with mundane events and insight into what motivates the peasants essential to the survival of the family farm. And she makes pessimistic observations about the complexity of changing times in a society where the persistent reliance on feudal relationships and agriculture is finally crumbling. </p><p> An academic manqu�, Simeti researches and ruminates on the mythological underpinnings of the many holidays and festivals that punctuate the rhythm of Sicilian life. She focuses particularly on the Greek goddesses Persephone and Demeter, who held Sicily under their protection. She eventually discovers a correlation between her own situation and the story of Persephone, who alternately inhabited the worlds of light and darkness.</p><b>Mary Taylor Simeti</b> is an American expert in Sicilian medieval and culinary history.

While the art in the book lends itself to many pencilers (Ha, Lee Bermejo, Chris Sprouse, etc.), the true allure is writer Ellis (Transmetropolitan, Planetary, Hellblazer). His dark, contemplative, and demented plot devices fit right in with the likes of contemporaries Alan Moore and John Layman and will keep you banging on the flashlight for one more twisted adventure well past dark. --Ben Spanner</p><h2>Brain Rules for Baby: How to Raise a Smart and Happy Child from Zero to Five</h2><p>What&#x2019;s the single most important thing you can do during pregnancy?

And to survive, Jodahs must find the one thing the Oankali&#39;s amazing science cannot provide--a miracle. The gripping climax to Butler&#39;s acclaimed Xenogenesis trilogy.</p><p>This conclusion to the Xenogenesis series (<i>Dawn</i> and <i>Adulthood Rights</i>) focuses on Jodahs, the child of a union between humans, alien Oankali, and the sexless ooloi. The Oankali and ooloi are part of an extraterrestrial species that saved humanity from nuclear oblivion, but many humans feel the price for their help is too high: the Oankali and ooloi intend to genetically merge with humanity, creating a new species at the expense of the old. Even though the Oankali have--against their better judgment--created a human colony on Mars so that humanity as a species can continue unaltered, many human "resisters" either have not heard of the Mars colony or don't believe the Oankali will allow them to live there. Jodahs, who was thought to be a male but who is actually maturing into the first ooloi from a human/Oankali union, finds a pair of resisters who prove that some pure humans are still fertile. These humans may be his only hope to find successful mates, but they have been raised to revile and despise his species above all else.Octavia E.

Over 1,000 illustrations and 175,000 words of text.</p><p>Ray Smith is a writer, illustrator and lecturer at many art schools, including Chelsea School of Art and University of Plymouth. In 1990 he was appointed by HM Government to serve as a member of the Art Working Group for the National Curriculum. He has won a number of art awards, including a Royal Society of Arts Art for Architecture Award. Ray lives in Somerset.In this handsome and substantial handbook, a classic approach to the technical aspects of art, British artist Smith presents a wealth of information on established materials that he organizes first by function--pigments, resins, solvents, and the like--then by media categorized according to discipline. For instance, his section on drawing contains detailed entries on oil pastels, charcoal, and conte crayon. Painting elicits descriptions and depictions of the uses of watercolor, oils, and acrylics. In the printmaking and digital media and photograpzxzhy categories, Smith focuses more on method than media, with subsections on intaglio, lithography, and screenprinting in the former, and, in the latter, a 10-page discussion of computer manipulation of digital images. Throughout, he amply employs full-color illustrations and demonstrations as examples and teaching aids.

Rooted in notions of American exceptionalism, manifest destiny, and racism, the legal framework that emerged from the war laid the groundwork for the Monroe Doctrine, the Dred Scott decision, and U.S. westward expansion over the course of the nineteenth century, as Deborah Rosen explains in <i>Border Law</i>.</p><p>When General Andrew Jackson&#x2019;s troops invaded Spanish-ruled Florida in the late 1810s, they seized forts, destroyed towns, and captured or killed Spaniards, Britons, Creeks, Seminoles, and African-descended people. As Rosen shows, Americans vigorously debated these aggressive actions and raised pressing questions about the rights of wartime prisoners, the use of military tribunals, the nature of sovereignty, the rules for operating across territorial borders, the validity of preemptive strikes, and the role of race in determining legal rights. Proponents of Jackson&#x2019;s Florida campaigns claimed a place for the United States as a member of the European diplomatic community while at the same time asserting a regional sphere of influence and new rules regarding the application of international law.</p><p>American justifications for the incursions, which allocated rights along racial lines and allowed broad leeway for extraterritorial action, forged a more unified national identity and set a precedent for an assertive foreign policy.</p></p><p>Deborah Rosen is Professor of History at Lafayette College.&#x201c;Rosen not only provides a full account of the border conflict but also offers a thorough discussion of how the campaign reflected contemporary views of the young nation&#x2019;s place in the world... Rosen argues convincingly that the Seminole War established a pattern of assertive U.S. behavior that defined the early decades of U.S. history, leading to expanded economic/political opportunities but also inevitable conflict with Native Americans and regional neighbors.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>S. J. Ramold</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In the early American republic, empire-builders headed west&#x2015;to Louisiana, Texas, and the Pacific. But first they went to Florida. There, as Deborah Rosen shows in this magisterial study of Andrew Jackson&#x2019;s Seminole War, Americans pioneered the legal doctrines and practices that would underpin the United States&#x2019; expansion for the next century. Blending legal history with borderland history, Indian history, the history of slavery, and military and diplomatic history, <i>Border Law</i> is a major contribution to the story of how America&#x2019;s empire of liberty became an empire.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eliga Gould, author of <i>Among the Powers of the Earth: The American Revolution and the Making of a New World Empire</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Deborah Rosen&#x2019;s provocative <i>Border Law</i> conceptualizes the Seminole War as a defining moment of American nation-building. Beyond the diplomatic high-handedness and low territorial motives, Rosen finds that Americans struggled creatively to match their ambitions with the law of nations. On the floor of Congress and beyond, popular desire for spatial expansion, racial exclusion, and national justice overrode conventional understandings of international diplomacy and law, helping to remake that law along the way. Among other virtues, Rosen puts Native Americans, Spaniards, and Britons at the center of early American history. Part of a new political history that blends diplomacy, law, and political culture, Rosen&#x2019;s in-depth examination bridges the Early Republic and Jacksonian America.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel Hulsebosch, New York University School of Law</b></p><h2>Nightwork</h2><p>A widely published travel writer provides a comprehensive listing of available package tour options, describing tour operators and their offerings and presents guidance in judging and selecting package tours</p><p></p><h2>Imperial Blandings : Pigs Have Wings&#39;, &#39;Full Moon&#39;, &#39;Service With a Smile</h2><p>Cover worn, page edges tanned.

He tried a number of careers including farming, law, commercial art and advertising, and started writing short stories, intended for sale, in 1925. From 1930 to 1939 he wrote short stories of various kinds under different names, almost exclusively for American publications, while also writing detective novels. During the war he was in the Civil Service and then the Army. In 1946 he went back to writing stories for publication in the USA and decided to try a modified form of science fiction, a form he called &#39;logical fantasy&#39;. As John Wyndham he wrote The Day of the Triffids, The Kraken Wakes, The Chrysalids, The Midwich Cuckoos (filmed as Village of the Damned), The Seeds of Time, Trouble with Lichen, The Outward Urge, Consider Her Ways and Others, Web and Chocky.

Author Charlotte Carter let me live in New York City for two hours; I finally found out exactly where Hell's Kitchen is, and without threat to my life. The mystery itself kept me guessing until the very end as to who the villain was, and the twist was authentic. Nanette, Carter's female protagonist, is a single, somewhat struggling musician living in the heart of Manhattan. Carter's take on this theme is original. Nanette is a saxophone player, African American, described as a Grace Jones look-alike, street wise as well as fashion conscious, and filled with insatiable curiosity. With all this in mind, Nanette's reactions to some of the tragedies that took place in this book were rather casual, and therefore contradictory to the character.

N. Roquelaure. <br> <br>In the traditional folk tale "Sleeping Beauty," the spell cast upon the lovely young princess and everyone in her castle can only be broken by the kiss of a Prince. Anne Rice's retelling of the Beauty story probes the unspoken implications of this lush, suggestive tale by exploring its undeniable connection to sexual desire.</p><p><b>PREFACE</b> <p></p> <p>I&#x2019;ve always loved the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, and found something erotic at its core. The Prince awakens Beauty with a kiss. And I thought, all right, what if he brought a kind of liberation, an induction into a world of bizarre yet irresistible delights? It has to be remembered that within the frame of a sadomasochistic fantasy like the Beauty trilogy, the readers are invited to identify with and enjoy the predicament of the slaves. The books aren&#x2019;t about literal cruelty; they&#x2019;re about surrender, the fun of imagining you have no choice but to enjoy sex. Beauty&#x2019;s slavery is delicious, sensuous, abandoned, and ultimately liberating. This is all part of the framework. And it seemed to work exquisitely with the old fairy tale. And of course the fairy tale removes us from everyday life; it removes us from the intrusion of garish headlines, literal violence, and all the ugliness of crime. We go into a gilded dream here, luscious and engulfing, in which we&#x2019;re free to imagine all sorts of things&#x2014;a fairy-tale world indeed.</p> <p>As Anne Rice, I&#x2019;m known for certain kinds of novels; the Roquelaure books retain the name Roquelaure (even with my name added) to indicate that this is something &#x201c;different.&#x201d; If Anne Rice is one kind of savory dish, well this is another entirely. And some might find it far too spicy for their taste. I don&#x2019;t like the idea of confusing or disappointing readers, so the pen name helps with that. Of course, there are many people who have read all my work, including the Roquelaure novels, and they see me as a multifaceted writer. But the Roquelaure material is erotica, without reservation, and it needs that pen name on the label, so to speak. The pen name says: Anne Rice is doing something very different here.</p> <p>I felt I needed the anonymity of the pen name to write freely, to pursue an authentic erotica without being inhibited or self-conscious. And it worked wonders to imagine myself &#x201c;cloaked&#x201d; by the name Roquelaure, which is a kind of French cloak&#x2014;named after the Frenchman who popularized it. My father was still living then and I didn&#x2019;t want him to know about the books either. In fact, there were lots of friends and relatives whom I didn&#x2019;t want to worry about as I developed the writing. There was quite a bit of exposure involved in writing such graphic sexual fantasies. It was frightening now and then, and it was thrilling. Eventually, I told my father about the books, asking him not to read them, and I did put my name on them. I adjusted completely to people knowing I&#x2019;d written them. But only after I&#x2019;d finished with the trilogy&#x2014;as I recall.</p> <p>A pen name enables you not only to cloak what you are doing from friends and family; it gives you a new freedom to do something you would not do as yourself. I have thought of writing some new erotica, and I must confess I imagined using a new pen name for it. I don&#x2019;t know whether I&#x2019;ll pursue it, but I do find the freedom of the pen name attractive.</p> <p>When the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy books were first published, they were underground books. They had the backing of a major mainstream publisher, yes, but the publication, though dignified and beautiful, was relatively quiet. But different readers embraced the books almost at once. They clearly appealed to young people, and older married people, to gays and straights. And they&#x2019;ve sold steadily ever since they first appeared. Women come up to me at signings with babies in strollers and giggle and laugh and say, &#x201c;We love your dirty books.&#x201d; People of all ages, actually, present the books to be signed.</p> <p>Why do I think these particular books have been popular? Two reasons. First, I think it is because they involve no harsh, garish violence at all. They involve game playing, really. No one is burned or cut or hurt. Certainly no one is killed. Indeed the whole sadomasochistic predicament is presented as a glorified game played out in luxurious rooms and with very attractive people, and involving very attractive slaves. There are endless motifs offered for dominance and submission, for surrender and love. It&#x2019;s like a theme park of dominance and submission, a place to go to enjoy the fantasy of being overpowered by a beautiful man or woman and delightfully compelled to surrender and feel keening pleasure, without the slightest serious harm. I think it&#x2019;s authentic to the way many who share this kind of fantasy really feel. I think what makes it work for people is the combination of the very graphic and unsparing sexual details mixed with the elegant fairy-tale world.</p> <p>Unfortunately a lot of hackwork pornography is written by those who don&#x2019;t share the fantasy, and they slip into hideous violence and ugliness, thinking the market wants all that, when the market never really did. Second, this is shamelessly erotic. It pulls no punches at being what it is. It&#x2019;s excessive and it is erotica. Before these books, a lot of women read what were called &#x201c;women&#x2019;s romances&#x201d; where they had to mark the few &#x201c;hot pages&#x201d; in the book. I said, well, look, try this. Maybe this is what you really want, and you don&#x2019;t have to mark the hot pages because every page is hot. Every page is about sexual fulfillment. Every page is meant to give you pleasure. There are no boring parts. Yet it&#x2019;s very &#x201c;romantic.&#x201d; And well, I think this worked.</p> <p>Lots of people enjoy imagining themselves passive, in the hands of a beautiful lover, male or female, who will force them to enjoy themselves. It&#x2019;s a common idea, and it cuts across gender and class. Men love these sorts of fantasies as much as women. And these books offer all kinds of gender combinations; women dominating men and women; men dominating men and women. The books offer ornate and seductive variations on the themes; and all of it is interwoven in stories with real characters, and again, the emphasis is on a lush, sensuous realm in which all this happens. There are very detailed descriptions of physical interaction and response; but the fairy-tale spell is sustained.</p> <p>I also went all the way with exploring the mind-set of sadomasochism as I saw it, letting the fantasy characters talk in depth about what they felt and what they enjoyed and what thrilled them as they were humiliated and overwhelmed. I suspect that for some readers, this kind of deep exploration of the mentality of the participants was entirely new.</p> <p>Is this why they appealed to so many, because people want this very combination of elements? Perhaps.</p> <p>I certainly never found the combination of elements I wanted in anyone else&#x2019;s erotica. So I offered what I could not find; a light touch; elegance; preciseness; a dreamlike kingdom; a dream in which people explore their need to be passive and to &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; that someone gorgeous and irresistible is &#x201c;making&#x201d; them do it.</p> <p>Psychiatrists have written volumes on the nature of the sadomasochistic fantasy, but when I wrote the trilogy I didn&#x2019;t know of any fiction that really enabled you to slide in it and &#x201c;play&#x201d; the way I wanted to play. So I wrote the books I couldn&#x2019;t find.</p> <p>I never thought a book as eccentric as <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> would have mass appeal. I only knew that I wanted to &#x201c;be with the vampire&#x201d; in the story, tell it from his point of view. I wanted to be inside his head and heart and reveal his voice and his pain. Now as it turned out, other people were exploring this same kind of thing&#x2014;the backstory of the villain, the monster, or the comic book hero and heroine who&#x2019;d always been described from a distance or in brittle form. People wanted to explore all kinds of super characters and hear their intimate musings. And I began to see more and more of this&#x2014;movies made in which Superman could bear his soul, and Lois Lane could really talk about what it meant to love him. The demand for such romantic fantasies grew and grew. But did I have any idea that would happen? No. I wrote what I wanted to read. Well, the same thing is true with the Beauty books.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t know whether that many other people had the fantasies. After all, we didn&#x2019;t talk much about them. Only a small elite knew about the mysterious <i>Story of O</i>. But I knew I had these fantasies, and I wanted to share them, and I felt an overwhelming desire to do them &#x201c;right.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t want to compromise, water them down, or shrink from the most humiliating detail. I wanted to really delve into intense sensuous pleasure but put a gilded frame around a safe place for the reader from which he or she could go and come with ease.</p> <p>Of course these books have from time to time been banned. I never expected a library to stock the Beauty trilogy. I know that many libraries respond to community standards, and I just never thought about it much at all. I did notice and I couldn&#x2019;t help notice that the books sold well and steadily, and that at every signing I gave, people brought them to be signed. Recently, I&#x2019;ve signed as many copies of the Beauty books as I have of any other book I&#x2019;ve written. So I don&#x2019;t worry too much about being banned. I&#x2019;ve always shocked people. Years ago, I published a novel about the eighteenth-century castrati opera singers, titled <i>Cry to Heaven</i>. Someone brought a copy back to a bookstore in Stockton, California, and demanded his money back. &#x201c;This is pornography,&#x201d; he said. There are always some people objecting to what I do. I&#x2019;m grateful the Beauty books have been embraced and sustained over the years.</p> <p>As a feminist, I&#x2019;m very much supportive of equal rights for women in all walks of life. And that includes for me the right of every woman to write out her sexual fantasies and to read books filled with sexual fantasies that she enjoys. Men have always enjoyed all kinds of pornography. How can it be wrong for women to have the same right? We&#x2019;re sexual beings! And fantasy is where we can do the things we can&#x2019;t do in ordinary life. A woman has a right to imagine herself carried away by a handsome prince, and to choose for herself as she writes, the color of his hair and eyes, and imagine his silky voice. She has a right to make him as tall as she wants and as strong as he wants. Why not? Men have always allowed themselves such fantasies.</p> <p>Famous madams have told us for decades that powerful men love to be dominated and come to them for role playing that allows the male client to be passive. In fact, some madams have said that men who enjoy playing the passive role are often men who are very powerful in real life. Well, women today are more powerful than ever. They&#x2019;re Supreme Court judges, senators, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, executives, soldiers, cops. They can excel in all walks of life. And why shouldn&#x2019;t they be able to go home from the courtroom, the university, or the office and kick back and &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; they&#x2019;re being swept away to the Queen&#x2019;s sadomasochistic kingdom where all the fairy-tale court will watch them being ravaged by the handsome Prince?</p> <p>The literary world today is wide open for all kinds of creative endeavors. We are in a new golden age in which fantasy, science fiction, speculative fiction, historical drama, horror, gothic, and supernatural romance are all mainstream. Well, the same holds true now obviously for erotica. People in general are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; as enjoyers of erotic books. The novel <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> has proved this. And I am discovering that the Beauty books in spite of all their playful excess&#x2014;are for the first time going mainstream.</p> <p>But I wouldn&#x2019;t continue Beauty&#x2019;s story. I felt that ended just the way I wanted. But I might write some more. I don&#x2019;t think I did all I could do in these books, within the fantasy itself, in admitting how much the slaves enjoyed it&#x2014;how they loved it. I&#x2019;d deepen that aspect, and still keep the tension, if I did them today.</p> <p>People are much more comfortable today admitting and talking about what they enjoy in fiction and film. Much more. People are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; about sexuality, period. The whole world knows women are sensual human beings as well as men. It&#x2019;s no secret anymore that women want to read sexy fiction just as men do, and there&#x2019;s a new frankness about the varieties of fantasies one might enjoy. So many clich�s have been broken and abandoned. And this is a wonderful thing.</p> <p>&#x2014;ANNE RICE</p> <p>JUNE 2012</p>A Roquelaure is the pen name of Ann Rice, a well published author of various gothic vamprire novels.

Whenever anyone mentions &#39;Reiver&#39;, no-one hesitates to add &#39;Border&#39;. It is an inextricable association, and rightly so. Nowhere else in Britain in the modern era, or indeed in Europe, did civil order break down over such a wide area, or for such a long time. For more than a century the hoof-beats of countless raiding parties drummed over the border. From Dumfriesshire to the high wastes of East Cumbria, from Roxburghshire to Redesdale, from the lonely valley of Liddesdale to the fortress city of Carlisle, swords and spears spoke while the law remained silent. Fierce family loyalty counted for everything while the rules of nationality counted for nothing.The whole range of the Cheviot Hills, its watershed ridges and the river valleys which flowed out of them became the landscape of larceny while Maxwells, Grahams, Fenwicks, Carletons, Armstrongs and Elliots rode hard and often for plunder. These were the Riding Times and in modern European history, they have no parallel.

For weeks, without a clear-cut reason for attacking through the forest, U.S. commanders nevertheless ordered units of as many as seven divisions into the woods to be chewed up by German infantry and artillery. Small units, cut off by the rugged terrain and trees, unable to employ tanks or artillery effectively, fought entrenched and camouflaged Germans in the woods and villages of the region. The troops were exposed to rain, sleet, and freezing temperatures without proper winter clothing. Many companies suffered huge numbers of casualties.<br>For many years after the war the full extent of the disaster was not well known outside army circles. Eventually the story of the campaign spread, but it remained overshadowed by the fame of the Bulge. Only in the last decade have military historians begun to look at the fighting in the Hurtgen Forest.<br>The book examines uncertainty of command at the army, corps, and division levels and emphasizes the confusion and fear of ground combat at the level of company and battalion - "where they do the dying." Its gripping description of the battle is based on government records, a rich selection of first-person accounts from veterans of both sides, and author Edward G. Miller's visits to the battlefield. The result is a compelling and comprehensive account of small-unit action set against the background of the larger command levels.<br>The book's foreword is by retired Maj. Gen. R. W. Hogan, who was a battalion commander in the forest.</p><p>Maj. Edward G. Miller is a&nbsp;retired army ordnance officer stationed in Germany. His most recent assignment was to the army's Command and General Staff College, where he completed most of this study in his off-duty hours. He earned the B.A. and M.P.A. degrees from Western Kentucky University and has completed several military training programs. His previous publications include articles in <i>Armor</i> and <i>Ordnance</i> magazines concerning development of U.S. armor doctrine.This tale of the disaster suffered by U.S. forces in Germany near the end of WWII is based on government records, veterans' accounts and the author's visits to the battlefield. Assigned to clear Germany's Hurtgen Forest of enemy troops, the U.S. 7th Corps high command concentrated on terrain features, road junctions and towns, failing to realize that the more important objectives were the nearby dams controlling the level of the water obstacle standing between the Americans and the Rhine, i.e., the Roer. Miller vividly describes the bloody confrontation in the forest near Aachen from late 1944 into early '45, with the Germans conducting a well-executed delaying action that bought time for a buildup of forces for their last-ditch Ardennes campaign. The ferocity of the fighting was typified by the experience of the 22nd Infantry, which lost 108 officers and 2575 enlisted men in exchange for four miles of tactically useless woods. Miller's detailed account of the climactic assault on the Schwammenauel Dam by the 78th Division drives home the theme of this well-researched study: the overriding importance of defining a clear and logical objective at the beginning of a military campaign. Major Miller is on active duty with the U.S. Army in Germany as an ordnance officer.

Understandably, this perspective has come under sharp attack, not only from mainstream environmentalists but also from ecosocialists, many of whom reject Marx outright. Kohei Saito&#x2019;s Karl Marx&#x2019;s Ecosocialism lays waste to accusations of Marx&#x2019;s ecological shortcomings.

Nine years ago she fled from the nunnery with a man. Now her lover is dead and she has come back, bringing her illegitimate son with her.<br> <br> She claims she is penitent, that she wants only to redeem her sin and find a safe haven for her child. By the law of the Church, neither she nor the child can be turned away, but their presence begins to stir doubts and questions in the hearts of some of the nuns about their own faithfulness to the enclosed life they live. However, these doubts become the lease of the problems Dame Frevisse must confront when her worldly troubles follow Sister Cecely and her son into the nunnery, pursuing her out of the life she claims to have left behind.<br> <br> Contrite Sister Cecely may be -- however much Frevisse may doubt it -- but truthful she is not, and as the apostate nun's lies begin to overtake her, dangers of more than one kind become an unwanted part of life in the priory.<br> <br> <i>"Overflowing with atmospheric details that make the complex historical setting come alive for modern readers..." - BookLoons</i></p><p>Margaret Frazer was a finalist for an Edgar(r) Award for both <i>The Servant's Tale</i> and <i>The Prioress' Tale</i>.</p><h2>Alfie&#39;s Christmas</h2><p><p><b>Alfie has been charming children and parents for generations, but this is his very first Christmas</b></p><p>A&nbsp;perfect gift, this beautiful storybook&nbsp;invites young readers to join&nbsp;Alfie and Annie Rose for Christmas, and covers every Christmas milestone.

I&#x2019;ve met lots of people, [but] I have never met anyone as interesting, or as fascinating, or as wise, as my Liverpool family.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Liverpool is not only the city in which Paul McCartney was born; it is the place in which he is rooted, the wellspring of the Beatles&#x2019; music and everything he has done since that fabulous group disbanded. Originally a small inlet or &#x2018;pool&#x2019; on the River Mersey, near its confluence with the Irish Sea, 210 miles north of London, Liverpool was founded in 1207, coming to significance in the seventeenth century as a slave trade port, because Liverpool faces the Americas. After the abolition of slavery, the city continued to thrive due to other, diverse forms of trade, with magnificent new docks constructed along its riverine waterfront, and ocean liners steaming daily to and from the United States. As money poured into Liverpool, its citizens erected a mini-Manhattan by the docks, featuring the Royal Liver Building, an exuberant skyscraper topped by outlandish copper birds that have become emblematic of this confident, slightly eccentric city.<br>&nbsp;<br>For the best part of three hundred years men and women flocked to Liverpool for work, mostly on and around the docks. Liverpool is and has always been a predominantly white, working-class city, its people made up of and descended in large part from the working poor of surrounding Lancashire, plus Irish, Scots and Welsh incomers. Their regional accents combined in an urban melting pot to create Scouse, the distinctive Liverpool voice, with its singular, rather harsh pronunciation and its own witty argot, Scousers typically living hugger-mugger in the city&#x2019;s narrow terrace streets built from the local rosy-red sandstone and brick.<br>&nbsp;<br>Red is the colour of Liverpool &#x2013; the red of its buildings, its left-wing politics and Liverpool Football Club. As the city has a colour, its citizens have a distinct character: they are friendly, jokey and inquisitive, hugely proud of their city and thin-skinned when it is criticised, as it has been throughout Paul&#x2019;s life. For Liverpool&#x2019;s boom years were over before Paul was born, the population reaching a peak of 900,000 in 1931, since when Liverpool has faded, its people, Paul included, leaving to find work elsewhere as their ancestors once came to Merseyside seeking employment, the abandoned city becoming tatty and tired, with mounting social problems.<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul&#x2019;s maternal grandfather, Owen Mohin, was a farmer&#x2019;s son from County Monaghan, south of what is now the border with Northern Ireland, and it&#x2019;s likely there was Irish blood on the paternal side of the family, too. McCartney is a Scottish name, but four centuries ago many Scots McCartneys settled in Ireland, returning to mainland Britain during the Potato Famine of the mid-1800s. Paul&#x2019;s paternal ancestors were probably among those who recrossed the Irish Sea at this time in search of food and work. Great-grandfather James McCartney was also most likely born in Ireland, but came to Liverpool to work as a housepainter, making his home with wife Elizabeth in Everton, a workingclass suburb of the city. Their son, Joseph, born in 1866, Paul&#x2019;s paternal grandfather, worked in the tobacco trade, tobacco being one of the city&#x2019;s major imports. He married a local girl named Florence Clegg and had ten children, the fifth of whom was Paul&#x2019;s dad.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aside from Paul&#x2019;s parents, his extended Liverpool family, his relatives &#x2013; what Paul would call &#x2018;the relies&#x2019; &#x2013; have played a significant and ongoing part in his life, so it is worth becoming acquainted with his aunts and uncles. John McCartney was Joe and Flo McCartney&#x2019;s firstborn, known as Jack. Paul&#x2019;s Uncle Jack was a big strong man, gassed in the First World War, with the result that after he came home &#x2013; to work as a rent collector for Liverpool Corporation &#x2013; he spoke in a small, husky voice. You had to lean in close to hear what Jack was saying, and often he was telling a joke. The McCartneys were wits and raconteurs, deriving endless fun from gags, word games and general silliness, all of which became apparent, for better or worse, when Paul turned to song writing. McCartney family whimsy is in &#x2018;Maxwell&#x2019;s Silver Hammer&#x2019; and &#x2018;Rocky Raccoon&#x2019;, also &#x2018;Rupert and the Frog Song&#x2019;.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a son after Jack who died in infancy; then came Edith (Edie) who married ship steward Will Stapleton, the black sheep of the family; another daughter died in infancy; after which Paul&#x2019;s father, James, was born on 7 July 1902, known to all as Jim. He was followed by three girls: Florence (Flo), Annie and Jane, the latter known as Gin or Ginny, after her middle name Virginia. Ginny, who married carpenter Harry Harris, was Paul&#x2019;s favourite relative outside his immediate family and close to her younger sister, Mildred (Milly), after whom came the youngest, Joe, known as Our Bloody Joe, a plumber who married Joan, who outlived them all. Looking back, Joan recalls a family that was &#x2018;very clannish&#x2019;, amiable, witty people who liked company. In appearance the men were slim, smartly dressed and moderately handsome. Paul&#x2019;s dad possessed delicate eyebrows which arched quizzically over kindly eyes, giving him the enquiring, innocent expression Paul has inherited. The women were of a more robust build, and in many ways the dominant personalities. None more so than the redoubtable Auntie Gin, whom Paul name-checks in his 1976 song &#x2018;Let &#x2019;em In&#x2019;. &#x2018;Ginny was up for anything. She was a wonderful mad character,&#x2019; says Mike Robbins, who married into the family, becoming Paul&#x2019;s Uncle Mike (though he was actually a cousin). &#x2018;It&#x2019;s a helluva family. Full of fun.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Music played a large part in family life. Granddad Joe played in brass bands and encouraged his children to take up music. Birthdays, Christmas and New Year were all excuses for family parties, which involved everybody having a drink and a singsong around the piano, purchased from North End Music Stores (NEMS), owned by the Epstein family, and it was Jim McCartney&#x2019;s fingers on the keys. He taught himself piano by ear (presumably his left, being deaf in his right). He also played trumpet, &#x2018;until his teeth gave out&#x2019;, as Paul always says. Jim became semi-professional during the First World War, forming a dance band, the Masked Melody Makers, later Jim Mac&#x2019;s Band, in which his older brother Jack played trombone. Other relatives joined the merriment, giving enthusiastic recitals of &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve Gone&#x2019; and &#x2018;Stairway to Paradise&#x2019; at Merseyside dance halls. Jim made up tunes as well, though he was too modest to call himself a songwriter. There were other links to show business. Younger brother Joe Mac sang in a barber-shop choir and Jack had a friend at the Pavilion Theatre who would let the brothers backstage to watch artists such as Max Wall and Tommy Trinder perform. As a young man Jim worked in the theatre briefly, selling programmes and operating lights, while a little later on Ann McCartney&#x2019;s daughter Bett took as her husband the aforementioned Mike Robbins, a small-time variety artiste whose every other sentence was a gag (&#x2018;Variety was dying, and my act was helping to kill it&#x2019;). There was a whiff of greasepaint about this family.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jim&#x2019;s day job was humdrum and poorly paid. He was a salesman with the cotton merchants A. Hannay &amp; Co., working out of an impressive mercantile building on Old Hall Street. One of Jim&#x2019;s colleagues was a clerk named Albert Kendall, who married Jim&#x2019;s sister Milly, becoming Paul&#x2019;s Uncle Albert (part of the inspiration for another of Paul&#x2019;s Seventies&#x2019; hits, &#x2018;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&#x2019;). It was perhaps because Jim was having such a grand old time with his band and his extended family that he waited until he was almost forty before he married, by which time Britain was again at war. It was Jim&#x2019;s luck to have been too young to serve in the First World War, and now he was fortunate to be too old for the Second. He lost his job with Hannay&#x2019;s, though, working instead in an aircraft factory during the day and fire-watching at night. Liverpool&#x2019;s docks were a prime German target during the early part of the war, with incendiary shells falling almost nightly. It was during this desperate time, with the Luftwaffe overhead and Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s armies apparently poised to invade from France, that Jim McCartney met his bride-to-be, Paul&#x2019;s mother Mary.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mary Mohin was the daughter of Irishman Owen Mohin, who&#x2019;d left the old country to work in Glasgow, then moving south to Liverpool, where he married Mary Danher and had four children: a daughter named Agnes who died in childhood, boys Wilfred and Bill, the latter known as Bombhead, and Paul&#x2019;s mother, Mary, born in the Liverpool suburb of Fazakerley on 29 September 1909. Mary&#x2019;s mother died when she was ten. Dad went back to Ireland to take a new bride, Rose, whom he brought to Liverpool, having two more children before dying himself in 1933, having drunk and gambled away most of his money. Mary and Rose didn&#x2019;t get on and Mary left home when still young to train as a nurse, lodging with Harry and Ginny Harris in West Derby. One day Ginny took Mary to meet her widowed mother Florence at her Corporation-owned (&#x2018;corpy&#x2019;) home in Scargreen Avenue, Norris Green, whereby Mary met Gin&#x2019;s bachelor brother Jim. When the air-raid warning sounded, Jim and Mary were obliged to get to know each other better in the shelter. They married soon after.<br>&nbsp;<br>Significantly, Paul McCartney is the product of a mixed marriage, in that his father was Protestant and his mother Roman Catholic, at a time when working-class Liverpool was divided along sectarian lines. There were regular clashes between Protestants and Catholics, especially on 12 July, when Orangemen marched in celebration of William III&#x2019;s 1690 victory over the Irish. St Patrick&#x2019;s Day could also degenerate into street violence, as fellow Merseysider Ringo Starr recalls: &#x2018;On 17th March, St Patrick&#x2019;s Day, all the Protestants beat up the Catholics because they were marching, and on 12th July, Orangeman&#x2019;s [sic] Day, all the Catholics beat up the Protestants. That&#x2019;s how it was, Liverpool being the capital of Ireland, as everybody always says.&#x2019; Mild-mannered Jim McCartney was agnostic and he seemingly gave way to his wife when they married on 15 April 1941, for they were joined together at St Swithin&#x2019;s Roman Catholic Chapel. Jim was 38, his bride 31. There was an air raid that night on the docks, the siren sounding at 10:27 p.m., sending the newlyweds back down the shelter. Bombs fell on Garston, killing eight people before the all-clear. The Blitz on Liverpool intensified during the next few months, then stopped in January 1942. Britain had survived its darkest hour, and Mary McCartney was pregnant with one of its greatest sons.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>JA M E S PAU L M c CARTNEY<br>Although the Luftwaffe had ceased its bombing raids on Liverpool by the time he was born, on Thursday 18 June 1942, James Paul McCartney, best known by his middle name, was very much a war baby. As Paul began to mewl and bawl, the newspapers carried daily reports of the world war: the British army was virtually surrounded by German troops at Tobruk in North Africa; the US Navy had just won the Battle of Midway; the Germans were pushing deep into Russian territory on the Eastern Front; while at home Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x2019;s government was considering adding coal to the long list of items only available on ration. Although the Blitz had passed for Liverpool, the war had three years to run, with much suffering and deprivation for the nation.<br>&nbsp;<br>As his parents were married in a Catholic church, Paul was baptised into the Catholic faith at St Philomena&#x2019;s Church, on 12 July 1942, the day the Orange Order marches. Though this may have been coincidental, one wonders whether Mary McCartney and her priest, Father Kelly, chose this day to baptise the son of a Protestant by way of claiming a soul for Rome. In any event, like his father, Paul would grow up to have a vague, non-denominational faith, attending church rarely. Two years later a second son was born, Michael, Paul&#x2019;s only sibling. The boys were typical brothers, close but also rubbing each other up the wrong way at times.<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul was three and Mike one when the war ended. Dad resumed his job at the cotton exchange, though, unusually, it was Mum&#x2019;s work that was more important to the family. The 1945 General Election brought in the reforming Labour administration of Clement Attlee, whose government implemented the National Health Service (NHS). Mary McCartney was the NHS in action, a relatively well-paid, statetrained midwife who worked from home delivering babies for her neighbours. The family moved frequently around Merseyside, living at various times in Anfield, Everton, West Derby and over the water on the Wirral (a peninsula between Liverpool and North Wales). Sometimes they rented rooms, other times they lodged with relatives. In 1946, Mary was asked to take up duties on a new housing estate at Speke, south of the city, and so the McCartneys came to 72 Western Avenue, what four-year-old Paul came to think of as his first proper home.<br>&nbsp;<br>Liverpool had long had a housing problem, a significant proportion of the population living in slums into the 1950s. In addition to this historic problem, thousands had been made homeless by bombing. In the aftermath of the war many Liverpool families were accommodated temporarily in pre-fabricated cottages on the outskirts of the city while Liverpool Corporation built large new estates of corporation-owned properties which were rented to local people. Much of this construction was undertaken at Speke, a flat, semi-rural area between Liverpool and its small, outlying airport, with huge industrial estates built simultaneously to create what was essentially a new town. The McCartneys were given a new, three-bedroom corpy house on a boulevard that leads today to Liverpool John Lennon Airport. In the late 1940s this was a model estate of new &#x2018;homes fit for heroes&#x2019;. Because the local primary school was oversubscribed, Paul, along with many children, was bussed to Joseph Williams Primary in nearby Childwall. Former pupils dimly recall a friendly, fat-faced lad with a lively sense of humour. A class photo shows Paul neatly dressed, apparently happy and confident, and indeed these were halcyon days for young McCartney, whose new suburban home gave him access to woods and meadows where he went exploring with the <i>Observer Book of Birds </i>and a supply of jam butties, happy adventures recalled in a Beatles&#x2019; song:<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Find me in my field of grass,</i><br><i>Mother Nature&#x2019;s son,</i><br><i>Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun.</i><br>(&#x2018;Mother Nature&#x2019;s Son&#x2019;)<br>&nbsp;<br>In the evening, Mum cooked while Dad smoked his pipe, read the newspaper or did the garden, dispensing wisdom and jokes to the boys as he went. There were games with brother Mike, and the fun of BBC radio dramas and comedy shows. Wanting to spend more time with her sons, Mary resigned fr...</p><h2>Theft of Life</h2><p>Theft of Life</p><p>Imogen Robertson grew up in Darlington, studied Russian and German at Cambridge, and now lives in London.

She worked to fasten two small bunches of bananas onto either end of a long pole. Her pet pig, Pua, napped by the trunk of a nearby tree. <br> &#x201c;Almost ready,&#x201d; said Moana. Pua lazily opened his eyes, rolled onto his back, and stretched out. He smiled as he looked up at&nbsp;her. &nbsp;<br> Moana lifted the pole over her head and rested it across her shoulders. She knew her dad, Chief Tui, would be there soon, and she wanted to be ready. Pua hopped up and stood beside Moana, prepared to follow her anywhere. <br> As Tui crested a hill, he couldn&#x2019;t help but beam at the sight of his eight-year-old daughter carrying the bananas the way farmers did. &#x201c;What do you have there?&#x201d; he asked. <br> Moana grinned. &#x201c;I thought I would bring them along as a treat for everyone,&#x201d; she explained. <br> &#x201c;How thoughtful,&#x201d; said Tui. &#x201c;Is it heavy?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Moana replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Of course you do,&#x201d; her father said proudly. <br> As Tui led Moana through a grove of coconut trees, he told her about his plans for their rounds in the village. They would spend most of the day helping a family build a fale&#x2014;a new home. Tui reminded Moana, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a chief&#x2019;s duty to make sure the people of Motunui are happy. If there is a problem or if someone needs a hand, the chief is there to help.&#x201d; <br> Moana nodded in understanding. Her dad had been preparing her for her future role as chief since the day she was born. She loved Motunui and its people, and was proud to help them. <br> As they continued walking, it seemed as though every villager was talking about a big upcoming event: the Tiale celebration. It was held once every ten years in honor of their brave ancestor Tiale and the flower that was named for her. When Moana and her dad stopped to check in on an elder, Laumei, she gratefully accepted one of Moana&#x2019;s bananas and asked if Moana was excited about her first Tiale celebration. <br> &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; answered Moana. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>so</i> excited!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;She has been counting the days,&#x201d; said Tui with a chuckle. <br> &#x201c;I remember my first one,&#x201d; said Laumei, gazing off into the distance as if watching a memory play out before her. &#x201c;Dancing, feasting, storytelling, the hunt for the Tiale flower, and then the competitions&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; . You will love it!&#x201d; <br> Soon Tui and Moana said goodbye to Laumei and continued on their rounds. <br> &#x201c;When someone finds the flower, the competitions start the next day, right?&#x201d; asked Moana. <br> Tui nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; <br> Earlier that morning, Tui had announced the events for the competitions: canoe racing, rock climbing, swimming, and cliff diving. Everyone interested in competing quickly made plans to train&#x2014;including Moana. <br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to compete!&#x201d; exclaimed Moana. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking forward to cheering you on,&#x201d; said Tui. <br> &#x201c;I can swim, paddle, and climb, but I don&#x2019;t know how to cliff dive,&#x201d; Moana said with a shrug. &#x201c;The celebration starts tomorrow. Do you think I can learn in time?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;If you work hard,&#x201d; said Tui. &#x201c;<i>And</i> find a good teacher.&#x201d; Just then, they reached the family working on their new fale. <br> Tui greeted them, and Tautai, the father of the family, showed them around the site. &#x201c;The holes are almost done, and we have the posts all ready,&#x201d; Tautai explained. <br> Tui was happy to hear it, and knew he and Moana would be able to help. <br> When Moana offered everyone a banana, they gratefully accepted. &#x201c;Nice touch,&#x201d; said Toa, the family&#x2019;s grandmother. <br> Moana set down the bananas and joined her dad. &#x201c;You can hold the posts in place while we fill in the holes,&#x201d; he said. <br> Moana grabbed one of the posts and held it firmly as a villager from a nearby fale filled in the space around it with dirt, packing it down tightly. Pua planted himself beside her and munched on banana peels. <br> Moana and her dad worked for some time before continuing their walk through the village. Later that afternoon, while they helped a farmer secure one of his animal pens, Moana&#x2019;s friend Vailele approached. &#x201c;Hi, Moana!&#x201d; she said excitedly. <br> Moana waved energetically at Vailele, thrilled to see her. Pua rolled over at Vailele&#x2019;s feet and stared up at her. She giggled and greeted him with a scratch. <br> &#x201c;Want a banana?&#x201d; Moana asked. &#x201c;There are only a few left.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; said Vailele, grabbing one. She peeled it and told Moana she was on her way to the shore. &#x201c;Some of the villagers are making a big picture in the sand for the celebration.&#x201d; Vailele took a bite of banana. &#x201c;Dee-licious!&#x201d; she said with her mouth full. <br> &#x201c;Oh yes!&#x201d; said Moana. &#x201c;Gramma Tala told me about that. I can&#x2019;t wait to see it.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Once we finish here, you can go with Vailele to the shore and help,&#x201d; said Tui. <br> Grins spread across Moana&#x2019;s and Vailele&#x2019;s faces. &#x201c;Thanks, Dad!&#x201d; said Moana. <br> Moments later, the girls hurried off, with Pua trotting beside them. <br> &#x201c;Can you believe the opening ceremony is <i>tomorrow</i>?&#x201d; said Vailele, her eyes as big as coconuts. <br> &#x201c;I know!&#x201d; said Moana. &#x201c;And then the search for the flower!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;And once it&#x2019;s found&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Vailele looked at Moana with a sly smile. <br> &#x201c;The competitions!&#x201d; they cried in unison. <br> &#x201c;I really want to try rock climbing,&#x201d; said Vailele. &#x201c;But I have a tiny problem. Anything higher than&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t know, my head? Well, it makes me feel like I have a rainstorm brewing inside my belly.&#x201d; She took a deep breath. &#x201c;But in the spirit of Tiale, I will conquer my fear and find my bravery!&#x201d; She raised her arms, as if showing off her muscles. <br> &#x201c;You can do it,&#x201d; Moana said. Then she pointed to a nearby rock face. &#x201c;That looks like a good place to practice.&#x201d; <br> Vailele nodded, ran toward it, and shouted at the rocks, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to climb you!&#x201d; She placed one foot on a bulging rock, found a notch to grab, and lifted herself up. <br> Moana climbed alongside her while Pua stayed on the ground. The little pig stuck his snout into the dirt, looking for something interesting to eat or play with. <br> As they slowly made their way up, Moana explained that she was going to compete in at least three of the events.

All that digging in the dirt had left Pua with a beetle clinging to his snout. Moana picked up the bug, and it flew away. <br> &#x201c;Is he okay?&#x201d; asked Vailele, stepping back on the ground. <br> &#x201c;It was a big scary beetle! Right, Pua?&#x201d; Moana explained playfully. &#x201c;But you were very brave.&#x201d; She comforted him with a pat. The little pig smiled proudly, then followed the girls toward the shore. When they reached the sand, Moana and Vailele both gasped.

Betty Pack, the subject of this latest biography by Lovell (The Sound of Wings, 1989; Straight on Till Morning, 1987), was a typical woman spy. Not so typical, though, was the significance of her accomplishment. Acknowledged as responsible for providing some of the most important British communications intelligence of WW II, the American-born Pack was a woman ``who took life as she found it, happily meeting challenge after challenge head-on, no matter what the consequences of the collision.'' Described as the most beautiful debutante of the Washington season, she was married at 19 to Arthur Pack, a British diplomat who had impregnated her. The child's birth was kept a secret for many years as Pack, a ``dreadful parent,'' let her son be reared by a foster family in England. Her espionage activities began while stationed in Civil War Spain and continued when her husband was transferred to Poland, where she seduced a top-ranking Pole from whom she learned details of the German Enigma code-machine. Her most significant triumphs, though, came in Washington. There, she seduced and turned an Italian admiral, as well as a Vichy French diplomat from whom she obtained ciphers that gave the Allies vital information about enemy movements. Loyal but unreflective, Pack had methods that were daring and unorthodox--her after-hours nude appearance at the French Embassy so stunned a suspicious nightwatchman that he fled, facilitating the opening of the safe holding the ciphers. Pack's life in France after the war was poignantly anticlimactic; she began writing her memoirs, but died in 1963 from cancer before they were complete. Solid research and tribute paid where due, though Pack, despite all the glamorous and daring things she did, and despite Lovell's best efforts, never quite comes alive here. Disappointing. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>An entertaining biography that reads like a novel, this is the story of a real-life spy heroine, Pack, a diplomat's wife who was one of Britain's most successful spies during World War II. Relying upon her charm, intelligence, and connections in the diplomatic world, she met and became the lover of diplomats and other officials, from whom she obtained vital secrets in a dangerous and exciting game of espionage. The author has thoroughly researched and carefully documented her subject, presenting the story of Pack in all of its dimensions, revealing in the process a woman who led a flawed but fascinating life. This carefully crafted, well-written, and readable book should appeal to a variety of readers, from World War II buffs to intrigue aficionados. Lovell is the author of two other skillful biographies of interesting women, Straight on Till Morning: The Biography of Beryl Markham ( LJ 9/15/87) and The Sound of Wings: The Life of Amelia Earhart ( LJ 10/15/89).

Next, it discusses the eccentric pre-moderns James McNeill Whistler and Albert Pinkham Ryder, the competing American Impressionists and Realists in the early twentieth century, and such now-historic avant-garde figures as Alfred Stieglitz, Marsden Hartley, Arthur Dove, and Elie Nadelman. Two appreciations of Edward Hopper and appraisals of Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol round out the volume. <br><br>America speaks through its artists. As Updike states in his introduction, &#x201c;The dots can be connected from Copley to Pollock: the same tense engagement with materials, the same demand for a morality of representation, can be discerned in both.&#x201d; <br><br>On<i> Just Looking</i><br><br>&#x201c;Some of these essays are marvelous examples of critical explanation, in which the psychological concerns of the novelist drive the eye from work to work in an exhibition until a deep understanding of the art emerges.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Arthur Danto, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;These are remarkably elegant little essays, dense in thought and perception but offhandedly casual in style. Their brevity makes more acute the sense of regret one feels to see them end.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jeremy Strick, <i>Newsday</i></p><p>John Updike was born in 1932, in Shillington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Harvard College in 1954 and spent a year in Oxford, England, at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. From 1955 to 1957 he was a member of the staff of <i>The New Yorker</i> and since 1957 has lived in Massachusetts. He is the author of more than fifty books, including collections of short stories, poems, and criticism. His novels have won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Howells Medal.*Starred Review* Updike's art criticism is free of abstraction and jargon and radiant in its curiosity and discernment. He can't help but bring a novelist's gift for psychological insight to his discussions of art, even as he expertly considers technique and aesthetics. American art is his passion, and within that realm, it is painting that he loves best, although he has included a judicious discussion of Alfred Stieglitz, the most painterly of photographers. Updike begins with a witty discussion of American portraiture and John Singleton Copley, then celebrates American landscape painting in his most rousing pieces, discussing with deep feeling the idea of the sublime during the oh-so-brief era in the New World when "nature reigned untamed" and offering agile responses to the paintings of Frederic Edwin Church, Martin Johnson Heade, and Winslow Homer. Forthright in his castigation of museum exhibitions burdened with dunning commentary, incisive in his interpretation of John Sloan and Arthur Dove, and brilliant in his response to Edward Hopper, Updike is receptivity personified, writing about art with ardent attention, knowledge, and profound appreciation. Updike's immersion in art assures us that there are oases, still, from the crassness of commercial images. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He goes to the movies, watches the tube, browses the art galleries, and works diligently on his stamp collection. But every now and then a call from the breezily efficient Dot sends him off to kill a total stranger. He takes a plane, rents a car, finds a hotel room, and gets back before the body is cold.</p><p>He's a real pro, cool and dispassionate and very good at what he does. Until one day when Dot breaks her own rule and books him for a hit in New York, his home base. She sends him to an art gallery opening, and the girl he gets lucky with steers him to an astrologer. He's a Gemini, his moon's in Taurus . . . and he's got a murderer's thumb.</p><p>Then the jobs start to go wrong. Targets die before he can draw a bead on them. The realization is slow in coming, but there's no getting around it: Somebody out there is trying to hit the hit man. Keller, God help him, has found his way on to somebody else's hit list.</p><p>Darker than Keller's conscience, and as riveting, surprising, and wickedly funny as his sensational <em>New York Times</em> bestselling debut, <em>Hit Man,</em> Lawrence Block's <em>Hit List</em> only serves to confirm the <em>Wall Street Journal's</em> estimation of the multiple-award-winning author as "one of the very best writers now working the beat."&nbsp; </p></p><p>Few mystery authors have a stable of protagonists as uniformly appealing as Lawrence Block's. Whether Block's taking the reader into PI Matthew Scudder's world of dimly lit bars and basement AA meetings, quirky burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr's used bookstore, or the international hot-spot hangouts of Evan Tanner, the spy who never sleeps, he always provides good company. John Keller, star of Block's 1998 story collection <i>Hit Man</i>, is a typical Block invention: an unassuming, get-the-job-done-and-move-on New York contract killer who collects stamps, does the morning crossword, eats Vietnamese takeout, and falls for the occasional woman. <p> When Keller gets off a plane in Louisville, ready to do the job he's been hired for, something about it feels wrong from the start. And when two people are killed in the motel room he's just vacated, he realizes he narrowly missed a setup, but can't figure out why. Then he goes to Boston to do another job, and afterwards dines in a coffee shop where another patron has the misfortune of leaving with Keller's raincoat: </p><blockquote>The <i>Globe</i> didn't have it. But there it was in the <i>Herald</i>, a small story on a back page, a man found dead on Boston Common, shot twice in the head with a small-caliber weapon.<p> Keller could picture the poor bastard, lying face-down on the grass, the rain washing relentlessly down on him. He could picture the dead man's coat, too. The <i>Herald</i> didn't say anything about a coat, but that didn't matter. Keller could picture it all the same.</p></blockquote> Keller's agent, Dot, puts the pieces--including the death of another contract killer she books occasionally--together and comes up with the seemingly crazy idea that a greedy hit man is knocking off the competition. In between other legit hits, romancing a commitment-shy artist, visiting an astrologer, and a long stint on jury duty, Keller slowly moves closer to the faceless nemesis he and Dot dub "Roger." But it's Dot, the woman of action, who figures out what to do about him. Though <i>Hit List</i> is too introspective to be a caper novel, and too funny to be noir, it's bound to find a rapt audience with fans of both subgenres. After two such engaging books, can <i>Hit Parade</i> be far behind? <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i><p>Lawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery genre. He has been named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America and is a four-time winner of the prestigious Edgar and Shamus Awards, as well as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. He received the Diamond Dagger from the British Crime Writers' Association&#x2014;only the third American to be given this award. He is a prolific author, having written more than fifty books and numerous short stories, and is a devoted New Yorker and an enthusiastic global traveler.</p></p><h2>The Century of the Gene</h2><p><p> In a book that promises to change the way we think and talk about genes and genetic determinism, Evelyn Fox Keller, one of our most gifted historians and philosophers of science, provides a powerful, profound analysis of the achievements of genetics and molecular biology in the twentieth century, the century of the gene. Not just a chronicle of biology's progress from gene to genome in one hundred years, <i>The Century of the Gene</i> also calls our attention to the surprising ways these advances challenge the familiar picture of the gene most of us still entertain. </p><p> Keller shows us that the very successes that have stirred our imagination have also radically undermined the primacy of the gene--word and object--as the core explanatory concept of heredity and development. She argues that we need a new vocabulary that includes concepts such as robustness, fidelity, and evolvability. But more than a new vocabulary, a new awareness is absolutely crucial: that understanding the components of a system (be they individual genes, proteins, or even molecules) may tell us little about the interactions among these components. </p><p> With the Human Genome Project nearing its first and most publicized goal, biologists are coming to realize that they have reached not the end of biology but the beginning of a new era. Indeed, Keller predicts that in the new century we will witness another Cambrian era, this time in new forms of biological thought rather than in new forms of biological life. </p></p><p>We've been under the spell of DNA for too long. Science historian and MacArthur Fellow Evelyn Fox Keller makes the case for radically new thinking about the nature of heredity in <i>The Century of the Gene</i>. This short, magisterial treatise examines 100 years of genetic thinking and finds outdated elements of Victorian beliefs still permeating our scientific writing. Despite compelling evidence that cytoplasmic and other nonchromosomal factors play important roles in development and even in the inheritance of traits, most discussion still relies on the master-slave (or manager-worker) relationship between the nucleus and the cell. Keller wants to move on; her proximate goal is to proceed from talking about genes to talking about genetic talk, the better to understand our biases. Her excitement at developments such as the Human Genome Project, despite her initial doubts, is only heightened by the prospect of vast stretches of uncharted intellectual territory. Ultimately, of course, her program matches that of the scientific enterprise--to more fully understand ourselves and our world. What comes after <i>The Century of the Gene</i>? It's an excellent question, and one that can only be answered once we leave behind the baggage of the past. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Evelyn Fox Keller</b> is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at MIT.

Lightning licked the clouds, bathing the whole scene in fleeting, brilliant white: the endless wilds, the stranded sixteen-year-old girl, and the pit demon poised to cave in her skull.<br>Yukiko turned and ran.<br>Trees stretched in every direction, a steaming snarl of roots and undergrowth, stinking of green rot. Branches whipped her face and tore her clothes, rain and sweat slicked her skin. She touched the fox tattoo sleeving her right arm, tracing its nine tails in prayer. The demon behind her bellowed as she slipped away, over root and under branch, deeper into the suffocating heat.<br>She screamed for her father. For Kasumi or Akihito. For anybody.<br>And nobody came.<br>The trees erupted and toppled in front of her, cleft to the heartwood by an enormous ten-span sword. Another oni appeared through the shower of falling green, tombstone mask for a face, lips pierced with rusted iron rings. Yukiko dived sideways as the great sword swept overhead, clipping her braid. Strands of long, black hair drifted down to the dead leaves.<br>She was rolling to her feet when the oni snatched her up, quicker than flies, its awful grip making her cry out. She could read the blasphemous kanji symbols carved on its necklace, feel the heat gleaming from its flesh. The first oni arrived, bellowing in delight. Her captor opened its jaws, a black maggot tongue lolling between its teeth.<br>She drew her tanto and stabbed the demon&#x2019;s hand, burying six inches of folded steel to the hilt. Blood sprayed, black and boiling where it touched her skin. The oni roared and hurled her against a nearby cedar. Her skull cracked against the trunk and she crashed earthward, rag-doll limp, the bloody knife skittering from her grip. Darkness reached up to smother her and she desperately clawed it away.<br><i>Not like this.</i><br>The first demon&#x2019;s laughter reminded her of screaming children, burning on Guild pyres in the Market Square. Its wounded comrade growled in a dark, backward tongue, stalking forward and raising its sword to end her. Lightning glinted on the blade&#x2019;s edge, time slowing to a crawl as the blow began to fall. Yukiko thought of her father again, wishing for all the world she&#x2019;d done what she&#x2019;d been told for just once in her life.<br>Thunder cracked overhead. A white shape burst from the undergrowth and landed on the oni&#x2019;s back; a flurry of razors, broken blue sparks and beating wings. The demon shrieked as the beast tore into its shoulders, ripping mouthfuls of flesh with a blood-slick beak.<br>The first oni growled, swinging its war club in a broad, hissing arc. Their attacker sprang into the air, tiny whirlwinds of falling leaves and snow-white petals dancing in time to the thrashing of its wings. The demon&#x2019;s tetsubo slammed across its comrade&#x2019;s shoulders. Bone splintered under the war club&#x2019;s impact, the oni&#x2019;s spine shattering like dark, wet glass. It crumpled to the ground, its last breath spattered in steaming black across Yukiko&#x2019;s terrified face.<br>The beast landed off-balance, digging bloodstained claws into the earth.<br>The oni glanced at its companion&#x2019;s corpse, shifting the war club from one hand to the other. Howling a challenge, it lifted the weapon and charged. The pair collided, beast and demon, crashing earthward and tumbling about in a flurry of feathers, petals and screams.<br>Yukiko wiped at the sticky black in her eyes, tried to blink away her concussion. She could make out blurry shapes rolling in the fallen leaves, dark splashes staining the white azalea blossoms. She heard a crunch, a choking gurgle, and then a vast, empty silence.<br>She blinked into the gloom, pulse throbbing behind her eyes.<br>The beast emerged from the shadows, feathers stained black with blood. It stalked toward her and lowered its head, growl building in its throat. Yukiko groped toward her tanto, pawing through the muck and sodden leaves for the blade as her eyesight dimmed. The darkness beckoned, arms open wide, promising an end to all of her fear. To be with her brother again. To leave this dying island and its poisoned sky behind. To lie down and finally sleep after a decade of hiding who and what she was.<br>She closed her eyes and wished she were safe and warm at home, nestled in her blankets, the air tinged blue-black with the smoke from her father&#x2019;s pipe. The beast opened its beak and roared, a hurricane scream swallowing the light and memories.<br>Darkness fell completely.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Jay Kristoff<br></p><h2>Polar Star</h2><p>Arkady Renko has made too many enemies and now he toils in obscurity on a Russian factory ship in the middle of the Bering Sea.

This method of clay decoration, practiced from Rome to Mesoamerica, continues to develop internationally. Slips allow ceramicists to give their works rich, intriguing surfaces in a range of hues. In <i>Techniques Using Slips</i>, expert potter John Mathieson explains how to formulate and apply slips successfully to embellish earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain.</p><p><i>Techniques Using Slips</i> gives step-by-step lessons on working with slips alone or with glaze using a range of firing methods. Beginning with a brief history of decorative slips over the millennia, this handbook guides readers through basic slip mixing and application methods, including sponging, marbling, stenciling, trailing, sgraffito, and inlay. Mathieson and forty of the world's best ceramic artists open their studios as they complete inspiring projects, revealing everything from the clays they use and englobe recipes to firing temperatures. Their artwork and techniques come to life in dozens of full-color photographs. In addition to creative approaches, <i>Techniques Using Slips</i> covers practical aspects of slip work, including equipment recommendations, supplier contact information, and important safety guidelines.</p><p>With more than 170 illustrations and clear, encouraging instruction, <i>Techniques Using Slips</i> is a must for any potter's library.

He grows up frolicking in the meadow, befriending butterflies and screech owls, and learning about the dark fear of all the woodland creatures: man. Over time, Bambi seeks out the wisdom of the prince of deer, a magnificent old stag who walks alone through the paths of the forest. Bambi is torn between his desire to be with his beloved mate, Faline, and his yearning for the knowledge and solitude the prince represents. He is also conflicted about his friend Gobo, who has returned to the forest after a winter living among humans. Gobo behaves unnaturally by strolling through the woods by day when other deer are sleeping, showing no fear of his natural mortal enemy.<p> This 1926 classic has been stretched and squeezed into many forms over the years, but the Felix Salten original should not be missed. With the richer, more highly wrought language of his time, Salten crafts a story layered in meaning, weighty with its message. The sometimes cruel, often joyful cycle of life continues, in spite of those who try to defy nature's law. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><b>The Prince of the Forest</b> <p> Bambi's life in the woods begins happily. There are forest animals to play with -- Friend Hare, the chattery squirrel, the noisy screech owl, and Bambi's twin cousins, frail Gobo and beautiful Faline. </p><p> But winter comes, and Bambi learns that the woods hold danger -- and things he doesn't understand. The first snowfall makes food hard to find. Bambi's father, a handsome stag, roams the forest, but leaves Bambi and his mother alone. </p><p> Then there is Man. He comes to the forest with weapons that can wound an animal. He does terrible things to Gobo, to Bambi's mother, and even to Bambi. But He can't keep Bambi from growing into a handsome stag himself, and becoming...the Prince of the Forest.</p></p><h2>The Wellspring: Poems</h2><p>Sharon Olds's dazzling new collection is a sequence of poems that reaches into the very wellspring of life. The poems take us back to the womb, and from there on to childhood, to a searing sexual awakening, to the shock of childbirth, to the wonder and humor of parenthood--and, finally, to the depths of adult love.<br><br>Always bold, musical, honest, these poems plunge us into the essence of experience. This is a highly charged, beautifully organized collection from one of the finest poets writing today.</p><p>The theme of Sharon Olds' fifth volume of poetry, <i>The Wellspring</i> is family and the sexual and sensual nature of the creation and sustenance of life--most often her own. From a time in her mother's life that preceded her own birth ("half of me/was deep in her body, dyed egg") to her father's testicles ("my brothers/and sisters are there, swimming by the cinerous/millions") to her son (who "waited inside me so many years/egg in my side before I was born"), her place in the reproductive life of her family is paramount. Even when the ostensible subject of a poem is as public as a campus antiwar demonstration, as in "May 1968," the real topic is creation and procreation: "The mounted police moved, near us/while we sang ... /if my period did not come tonight/I was pregnant.""Sharon Olds's poems are pure fire in the hands--risky, on the verge of falling, and in the end leaping up. I love the roughness and humor and brag and tenderness and completion in her work as she carries the reader through rooms of passion and loss."<br>--Michael Ondaatje</p><h2>Is It Me or My Meds?: Living with Antidepressants</h2><p><p> By the millennium Americans were spending more than 12 billion dollars yearly on antidepressant medications. Currently, millions of people in the U.S. routinely use these pills. Are these miracle drugs, quickly curing depression? Or is their popularity a sign that we now inappropriately redefine normal life problems as diseases? Are they prescribed too often or too seldom? How do they affect self-images? </p><p> David Karp approaches these questions from the inside, having suffered from clinical depression for most of his adult life. In this book he explores the relationship between pills and personhood by listening to a group of experts who rarely get the chance to speak on the matter--those who are taking the medications. Their voices, extracted from interviews Karp conducted, color the pages with their experiences and reactions--humor, gratitude, frustration, hope, and puzzlement. Here, the patients themselves articulate their impressions of what drugs do to them and for them. They reflect on difficult issues, such as the process of becoming committed to medication, quandaries about personal authenticity, and relations with family and friends. </p><p> The stories are honest and vivid, from a distraught teenager who shuns antidepressants while regularly using street drugs to a woman who still yearns for a spiritual solution to depression even after telling intimates "I'm on Prozac and it's saving me." The book provides unflinching portraits of people attempting to make sense of a process far more complex and mysterious than doctors or pharmaceutical companies generally admit. </p></p><p>David A. Karp is Professor of Sociology at Boston College, and the author of <i>Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness</i> and <i>The Burden of Sympathy: How Families Cope with Mental Illness</i>.David Karp records voices of ordinary people with depression; in so doing he tells us what it's like to take one of the commonest types of drugs for one of the commonest disorders. And what it's like is as complex as people and depression are in America in our time. A revealing book!<br> --Arthur Kleinman, author of <i>What Really Matters<br><br>Laying bare his own lifelong struggle with depression and often having to juggle a veritable cocktail of drugs, Karp says he has often wondered whether his personality is his own or just some kicked-up by-product of the meds. Even though the answer remains elusive, at least for him, he seems to be in good company, and his story combines with the alternately plaintive and upbeat psychiatric drug experiences of 50 interviewees, all diagnosed with various mental illnesses, to put a poignant face behind the title question.<br> --Donna Chavez (<i>Booklist</i> 2006-04-15)<br><br>In his sociological examination of the growing pill-popping population, Karp does not reveal himself to be for or against antidepressants. His bias is in favor of self authenticity, something frequently lost in medication.<br> --Pam Lilley (<i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> 2006-04-19)<br><br>In a 21st-century spin on Cartesian dualism, many of the millions of Americans taking psychotropic drugs wonder where their "authentic" self ends and the "drugged" one begins. Or, as Boston College sociology professor David A. Karp puts it, "Is it me or my meds?" Karp doesn't answer with statistics from drug trials or clinical and academic studies. Instead, he uses 50 in-depth interviews with the "experts"--adults and teens who take drugs for mental illness. The common and divergent strands of their stories are pieced together in a study informed by current sociological literature and Karp's longtime struggle with his own drug regimen (his "partial victory" easing off his antianxiety and antidepression meds opens the book). The question posed in the title remains unanswered, though, perhaps because it's not an either/or proposition. Rather, Karp argues persuasively that "it" might just be us, our meds, and the society we live in.<br> --Hannah Lobel (<i>Utne</i> 2006-09-01)<br><br>Karp sets out to weave the opinions he has collected from people who use psychotropic medication into a fascinating, incisive, and comprehensive essay. Indeed, the debate on psychiatric medications extends far beyond side-effects and drug effectiveness; incorporating questions of identity, social acceptance, the dominance of the biomedical model of disease, and the role of the drug industry in medicalising normal feelings for profit. The more I read, the more I agreed with Karp; taking a pill, is not simply taking a pill. Karp explores the conflicting concerns facing those who are prescribed such treatment. <i>Is It Me or My Meds?</i> offers doctors an insight into the difficult choices their patients face, but its greatest value may lie in showing those who take antidepressants that they are not alone. Understanding patients' views on this issue is an important part of deciding whether the U.S. public should be prescribed another $12 billion dollars of antidepressants next year.<br> --Lindsay Banham (<i>The Lancet</i> 2006-09-02)<br><br>Karp sets out to weave the opinions he has collected from people who use psycho-tropic medication into a fascinating, incisive, and comprehensive essay.

Heche is especially effective as the 9-year-old heroine, Trisha McFarland, who makes a fateful decision during an afternoon hike with her dysfunctional family. "The paths had forked in a 'Y.' She would simply walk across the gap and rejoin the main trail. Piece of cake. There was no chance of getting lost." As one might suspect, there is every chance she'll get lost--or worse--and taking the shortcut turns out to be a very bad choice indeed. At times Heche's reading may be too measured, but her narration is generally quite good and her steady portrayal of a young girl lost renders this tale all the more frightening. (Running time: 6.5 hours, 6 cassettes) <i>--George Laney</i>On a six-mile hike on the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail, nine-year-old Trisha McFarland quickly tires of the constant bickering between her older brother, Pete, and her recently divorced mother. But when she wanders off by herself, and then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut, she becomes lost in a wilderness maze full of peril and terror.<p>As night falls, Trisha has only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, and only her courage and faith to withstand her mounting fears. For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games and follows the gritty performances of her hero, relief pitcher Tom Gordon.

And indeed the rich decoration of Mystras&#39; churches - the Metropolis, the Aphendiko, the Peribleptos, or the Pantanassa, for instance - is a brilliant example of Constantinople&#39;s art at its greatest. Chatzidakis also has a chapter about each of the monuments and its architecture, painting, and sculptured decoration, with notes on the minor chapels. The Castle, the walls, the palaces, and the houses - the indispensable framework for a better understanding of the art of Byzantine Mystras - are examined in the last part of the book.This new edition retains the author&#39;s original text in its original form, comprising a detailed study of the monuments and the city over the centuries. All that is new is the additions and adjustments made necessary by recent findings, the result of conservation and restoration work on the archaeological site by the Fifth Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities (Sparta). Essential additions have also been made to the chapter on the Museum: these are due to the recent new exhibition on display since 2001, and in particular to the conservation and study of the dress of the Byzantine princess.

Now, with Evening, she gives us her most ambitious novel, a work of surpassing beauty. During a summer weekend on the coast of Maine, at the wedding of her best friend, Ann Grant fell in love. She was twenty-five. Forty years later--after three marriages and five children--Ann Lord finds herself in the dim claustrophobia of illness, careening between lucidity and delirium and only vaguely conscious of the friends and family parading by her bedside, when the memory of that weekend returns to her with the clarity and intensity of a fever-dream. <i>Evening</i> unfolds in the rushlight of that memory, as Ann relives those three vivid days on the New England coast, with motorboats buzzing and bands playing in the night, and the devastating tragedy that followed a spectacular wedding. Here, in the surge of hope and possibility that coursed through her at twenty-five--in a singular time of complete surrender--Ann discovers the highest point of her life. Superbly written and miraculously uplifting, <i>Evening</i> is a stirring exploration of time and memory, of love's transcendence and of its failure to transcend--a rich testament to the depths of grief and passion, and a stunning achievement.</p><p>As Ann Lord lies on her deathbed, her daughter delivers a balsam pillow from the attic. At first the ailing woman is confused, but suddenly the scent reminds her of the "wild tumult" she experienced 40 years earlier: <blockquote> Something stole into her as she walked in the dark, a dream she'd had long ago. The air was so black she was unable to see her arms, it was a warm summer night. Above her she could make out the dark line of the tops of spruce trees and a sky lit with stars. She felt the warm tar through the soles of her shoes. The boy beside her took her hand. </blockquote> In the porous world between conscious and unconscious the protagonist of <i>Evening</i> revisits the great passions of her life, along with its considerable disappointments. The boy in the dark remains the fixed point--not so much because he is the most important man in her life, but because of the untapped possibilities he represents. Meanwhile, friends and relations come to sit by Ann Lord's side as she veers between clarity and feverish recollection.<p> In her third novel, Susan Minot takes some new risks--her narrative spanning seven decades of memory and her style ranging from Stegneresque particularity to the exquisite abstraction Virginia Woolf perfected in <i>To the Lighthouse</i>. Equal parts memory and desire, fiction and poetry, <i>Evening</i> is a seductive story made more so by the measured pace of details emerging, one by one, like stars. <i>--Cristina Del Sesto</i></p>"Her best work yet, assured, supple, exhilarating in its nerve and cool momentum" --Joan Didion<p>"A stunning novel...a powerful story that cuts back and forth in time to give us both the defining moment in a woman's life and an understanding of how that moment has reverberated through the remainder of her days...Her evocation of her heroine's passion for Harris Arden is so convincing, her depiction of the world she inhabits is so fiercely observed...The difference between [<i>Monkeys</i> and <i>Evening</i>] attests to Susan Minot's growing ambition and <br>assurance as an artist" --Michiko Kakutani, <i>New York Times</i></p><p>"An absorbing drama...Minot writes with quiet perceptiveness and grace, pulling the<br>reader into Ann's deathbed reverie" --<i>Elle</i></p><p>"A brilliant lyric performance" --John Casey</p><p>"In spare and lovely language, Susan Minot has set forth a real life, in all its particularity and splendor and pain.

Sebald completed this extraordinary and important -- and already controversial -- book before his untimely death in December 2001. <br><b><br>On the Natural History of Destruction</b> is W.G. Sebald?s harrowing and precise investigation of one of the least examined ?silences? of our time. In it, the acclaimed novelist examines the devastation of German cities by Allied bombardment, and the reasons for the astonishing absence of this unprecedented trauma from German history and culture.<br><br>This void in history is in part a repression of things -- such as the death by fire of the city of Hamburg at the hands of the RAF -- too terrible to bear. But rather than record the crises about them, writers sought to retrospectively justify their actions under the Nazis. For Sebald, this is an example of deliberate cultural amnesia; his analysis of its effects in and outside Germany has already provoked angry and painful debate.<br><br>Sebald?s incomparable novels are rooted in meticulous observation; his essays are novelistic. They include his childhood recollections of the war that spurred his horror at the collective amnesia around him. There are moments of black humour and, throughout, the unmatched sensitivity of Sebald?s intelligence. This book is a vital study of suffering and forgetting, of the morality hidden in artistic decisions, and of both compromised and genuine heroics."Most writers, even good ones, write of what can be written; and move by their own angles into the discourse of their day. The very greatest write of what cannot be written; gravitating not toward the discourse but toward the silence. They break it, like the crust on untrodden snow. I think of [Anna] Akhmatova and Primo Levi, for example, and of W. G. Sebald, who died in 2001."<br>-Richard Eder, <i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"</i>Sebald is the real thing. . . .

Eventually, Homer withdrew from city life altogether to settle at Prout&#39;s Neck in New England. There he turned to watercolor, in part for financial reasons (they were easier to sell), but also because the newly popular medium enabled him to capture his impressions of scenery and landscapes encountered during his many travels with an immediacy and directness impossible in the more time-consuming oils. The Watercolors of Winslow Homer offers a lively and beautifully illustrated survey of the artist&#39;s work in a medium he pursued with originality and consummate skill. Of his more than 700 watercolors, over 140 are reproduced here, dating from the 1870s to the turn of the century. Divided into ten thematic chapters chronicling Homer&#39;s life and artistic progress, the book begins with the delightful paintings he made of children in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and ends with works bathed in the humid atmosphere of the tropics. Along the way readers will discover Homer&#39;s unparalleled range of expression, from the somber works he painted along the stormy English coast to the poetic evocations of the Adirondacks forest.</p><p>Winslow Homer&#39;s first medium was oil painting, although to make ends meet, he did commercial illustration and chronicled the New York City social scene.

With a 1951 fan letter, the young British poet introduced herself to Williams, and by 1959, Williams is congratulating Levertov on her growth. The letters also chronicle their search (individually and together) for a set of formal poetic principles, a search which culminated for Levertov in 1965, when she coined the term &#34;organic form.&#34; The warmth, the directness, the flavorsome individuality of the letters - 34 from Levertov and 42 from Williams - increased with their growing intimacy and mutual regard. Always intriguing, their independent-minded letters, which end with the elder poet&#39;s death in 1962, have great piquancy and charm. Denise Levertov herself initiated this project, and was then, in the year before her death, &#34;fascinated to read the exchange.&#34; This edition also includes the correspondence between Levertov and Williams&#39;s widow Florence. Professor Christopher MacGowan, the noted Williams scholar, contributes a superb introduction and informative annotations throughout.</p><p><p><strong>Denise Levertov</strong> (1923-1997) was a British born American poet. She wrote and published 20 books of poetry, criticism, translations. She also edited several anthologies. Among her many awards and honors, she received the Shelley Memorial Award, the Robert Frost Medal, the Lenore Marshall Prize, the Lannan Award, a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.</p><p>Besides being a practicing physician, <strong>William Carlos Williams</strong> (1883&#x2013;1963) was a poet, short-story writer, novelist, translator, playwright, and essayist whose contribution to the development of modern American poetry grew out of his commitment to recording the "local" experience of Rutherford, New Jersey, and its environs.</p>Much of the warmth and literary force in this brief book is due to the remarkable poet Denise Levertov. So great was her energy and life force, even in her early 70s, that the writer's friends were shocked by her sudden death last year. Levertov and Williams began corresponding when Levertov was still in her 20s and Williams already a sixtyish veteran of the modernist scene, yet it was clear who was teaching whom: a woman of powerful certainties, Levertov soon had Williams altering lines in his published plays. In one 1960 letter, he writes after her visit, "Your criticism of my own shortcomings is noted. I'll pay attention to what you say." And he soon became a one-man cheering section for her accomplishments; after recommending her three times for Guggenheim Fellowships, he crowed when she finally won in 1962: "No one ever deserved a Gug more than you!" Their letters do not consist only of literary matters; the poets also discussed the basic enjoyment of life?as when Levertov advises the elder poet, "Did you ever see N.Y. from one of the really high buildings? It's worth doing." Also "worth doing" as a life-enhancing experience is reading this charming and affectionate correspondence. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Power Lines (Petaybee Trilogy)</h2><p><b>The spellbinding sequel to &#x201c;Powers That Be,&#x201d;&nbsp;by Hugo and Nebula Award-winning authors Anne McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough.</b><br><br>The natives of Petaybee claimed their planet was sentient, but the officials of Intergal did not believe them . . . or want to believe them.

Then he profiles each reformer, providing a picture of their theology that does justice to the scope of their involvement in the reforming effort. <br><br>George details the valuable contributions these men made to issues historically considered pillars of the Christian faith: Scripture, Jesus Christ, salvation, the church, and last things.

In the case of Islam, there has been much recent confusion in the Western world centered on distorted portrayals of its core values. Born of ignorance, such confusion feeds the very problem at hand.</p><p><em>In The Heart of Islam</em> one of the great intellectual figures in Islamic history offers a timely presentation of the core spiritual and social values of Islam: peace, compassion, social justice, and respect for the other. Seizing this unique moment in history to reflect on the essence of his tradition, Seyyed Hossein Nasr seeks to "open a spiritual and intellectual space for mutual understanding." Exploring Islamic values in scripture, traditional sources, and history, he also shows their clear counterparts in the Jewish and Christian traditions, revealing the common ground of the Abrahamic faiths.</p><p>Nasr challenges members of the world's civilizations to stop demonizing others while identifying themselves with pure goodness and to turn instead to a deeper understanding of those shared values that can solve the acute problems facing humanity today. "Muslims must ask themselves what went wrong within their own societies," he writes, "but the West must also pose the same question about itself . . . whether we are Muslims, Jews, Christians, or even secularists, whether we live in the Islamic world or in the West, we are in need of meaning in our lives, of ethical norms to guide our actions, of a vision that would allow us to live at peace with each other and with the rest of God's creation." Such help, he believes, lies at the heart of every religion and can lead the followers of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) as well as other religious and spiritual traditions to a new future of mutual respect and common global purpose.</p><p><em>The Heart of Islam</em> is a landmark presentation of enduring value that offers hope to humanity, and a compelling portrait of the beauty and appeal of the faith of 1.2 billion people.</p></p><p><p>Seyyed Hossein Nasr is university professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University. Author of over fifty books, Professor Nasr is a well-known and highly respected intellectual figure both in the West and in the Islamic world.

The saga now continues as Silk wins over the local militia to his cause of revamping the government and becomes the first new <i>cald{&#x201a;}e</i>--an official wielding both religious and political power--in more than a century. After becoming acquainted with the tunnels and secret political players below the Whorl's inner surface and having regular contact with the "gods" on nearby video monitors, Silk gets a startling glimpse of the Whorl's greater dimensions and gains a real purpose beyond his own limited ambitions. Some may be pleased to notice the links Wolfe here makes to his earlier New Sun tetralogy, while others may find his predilection for rich characterization and cultural detail frustrating. Still, Wolfe's genius for world building has been equaled only in such works as Frank Herbert's Dune series. The Long Sun books represent science fiction at its most impressive. <i>Carl Hays</i>The resumption of the far-future Book of the Long Sun series starring Patera Silk in the city of Viron aboard the giant spaceship The Whorl. Wolfe (Lake of the Long Sun, 1993, etc.) sets epochal political battles in motion, throws gods into the fights, and imagines a bestiary of technologies and technologically created beings. There are more characters here than in a 19th-century Russian epic, and their names are even harder to remember (or spell). Not to fear. Wolfe has included a six-page directory of characters (``Gods, Persons, and Animals Mentioned in the Text''). Readers who have already been on The Whorl for the first two books of the series will plunge happily into this installment. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Critics have celebrated her storytelling talents, noting that she skillfully depicts "personal quirks that give her characters dimension." <em>Publishers Weekly</em> has raved that "Scottoline's legal background lends verisimilitude" to her stories, and <em>Kirkus Reviews</em> has praised her ability to devise terrific plots, proclaiming that she "comes up with the best hooks in the legal trade." Now this gifted author has summoned her array of talents to pen <em>Moment of Truth,</em> her most exciting and unpredictable novel yet--a riveting story of a man who frames himself for murder.</p><p>Attorney Jack Newlin comes home one evening to find his wife, Honor, dead on the floor of their elegant dining room. Convinced that he knows who killed her--and determined to hide the truth--Jack decides to make it look as though he did it. Staging the crime scene so that the evidence incriminates him, he then calls the police. And to hammer the final nail in his own coffin, he hires the most inexperienced lawyer he can find, a reluctant rookie by the name of Mary DiNunzio, employed at the hot Philadelphia firm of Rosato &amp; Associates.</p><p>Unfortunately for Jack, hiring Mary may turn out to be his only mistake.</p><p>Though inexperienced, Mary doubts Jack's confession and begins to investigate the crime. She finds that instead of having a guilty client who is falsely proclaiming his innocence, she has an innocent client who is falsely proclaiming his guilt. Her ethics and instincts tell her she can't defend a man who wants only one thing--to convict himself. Or can she? Smarter, gutsier, and more determined than she has any right to be, Mary decides to stick with the case. With help from the most unexpected sources, she sets out to prove what really happened--because as any lawyer knows, a case is never as simple as it seems.</p><p>And nothing is ever certain until the final moment of truth.</p></p><p><i>Moment of Truth</i> begins with what appears to be an open-and-shut case. Jack Newlin, a wealthy attorney with one of the most influential law firms in Philadelphia, killed his wife in a moment of drunken passion, stabbing her repeatedly when she announced she wanted a divorce. Or at least that is what he is claiming to the police.<p> The fact is, Jack is framing himself because he fears his wife's murder was his daughter's crime of passion. Sixteen-year-old Paige Newlin is a successful model whose relationship with her manager-mother had been famously rocky. To make sure that he's convicted, Jack hires rookie lawyer Mary DiNunzio to defend him. But Mary doesn't buy Jack's story, and neither does the senior detective on the case. In a fascinating turn on the usual courtroom tale, then, Jack struggles to maintain his false story of guilt while his lawyer and the police struggle to prove him innocent. Meanwhile, Mary wrestles with both her uncertainty as a lawyer and with her attraction for her client.</p><p> Lisa Scottoline, often identified as the "female John Grisham," has led the pack of female authors in the legal thriller genre, winning an Edgar for her second novel, <i>Final Appeal</i>. <i>Moment of Truth</i> does have moments that don't, in fact, ring true. Why is Jack Newlin so quick to forgive his daughter when he thinks she's killed her own mother? And if he's so concerned with her welfare, why did he absent himself from her upbringing? But it's nonetheless interesting for its innovative plot conceit and its examination of high-profile murder trials. If one is able to overlook the problems with Newlin's motivation, the story Scottoline weaves is a compelling one, and her heroine, Mary, is an enjoyable, self-doubting twist on the super-lawyer at the center of most legal thrillers. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Moment of Truth is the story of a man who frames himself for murder. When attorney Jack Newlin discovers his wife dead in their elegant home, he's convinced he knows who killed her -- and is equally determined to hide the truth. He decides to take the rap, and to seal his fate he hires the most inexperienced lawyer he can find, a reluctant rookie by the name of Mary DiNunzio from the hot Philadelphia firm of Rosato &amp; Associates. But hiring Mary may turn out to be his biggest mistake. Mary doubts Jack's confession, and her ethics and instincts tell her she can't defend a man who wants to convict himself. Smarter, gutsier, and more persistent than she has any right to be, Mary sets out to prove what really happened -- because as any lawyer knows, a case is never as simple as it seems.

Focusing primarily on a new guesthouse in California, this elegant volume shows how a classic Japanese house can be built to offer the warmth and comfort that modern homemakers require. <br><br>Len Brackett, rigorously trained as a temple carpenter in Kyoto, has spent decades adapting the ancient Japanese design aesthetic to Western needs.

Sheltered by towering trees, it is notable for two reasons. Although built in the 21st century, it exemplifies classic Japanese techniques and proportions refined over hundreds of years. Yet it also incorporates contemporary technologies and technical innovations for maximum comfort and energy efficiency. On entering the cottage, one's first sensation is the delicate fragrance of the cedar. Since the wood is unsealed, its fresh scent will last for decades. The finely planed surfaces invite touching, much like fine furniture. Visitors run their hands over the various woods &#x2013; Port Orford cedar, sugar pine, Western red cedar, English walnut and American chestnut &#x2013; and exclaim at their glass-like quality. The building is a small, private joy, giving no hint of its existence to passers-by on the street. Why and how was it built? <p>This book explains its construction &#x2013; or more precisely, its evolution. The aim of this book is to demonstrate that Japan&#x2019;s extraordinary architectural tradition can be a realistic choice in the modern world by presenting that process in detail, supplemented with examples from other Japanese-style houses built in the United States.</p></p><h2>America&#39;s Musical Life: A History</h2><p>A richly illustrated history of America&#39;s musical heritage ranges from the earliest examples of Native American traditional song and the sacred music of early settlers to the innovative sound of contemporary rock and jazz as it documents a diverse array of musical styles and the contributions of such legendary musicians as Charles Ives, George Gershwin, and Duke Ellington, among others.</p><p>Richard Crawford is Glen McGeoch Collegiate Professor of Music at the University of Michigan and a past president of the American Musicological Society.In 1846, the director of the Paris Opera told American composer William Henry Fry that Europeans "looked upon America as an industrial country--excellent for electric telegraphs, but not for Art." Over a century and a half later, Crawford (The American Musical Landscape), a professor of music at the University of Michigan and former president of the American Musicological Society, has thoroughly debunked that myth, at least in regard to music. In this ambitious, comprehensive history, Crawford speaks with equal authority on colonial psalmody and ragtime, minstrelsy and Gilded Age classical, and in an effort to highlight forgotten history, sketches biographies of influential individuals and the movements in which they participated. Through 40 chapters, he firmly roots each song, symphony or hymnal in its era, showing the political, environmental and social forces that have shaped composers and musicians, both professional and amateur. From an examination of Native American music to the church-centered song of the Puritan colonies, from the wildly popular minstrel shows to jazz and rock, the reader gets a fuller understanding of the America that produced and listened to the widely varied musical forms of our past. Crawford's book is egalitarian and accessible, and the occasional appearance of musicological jargon won't deter lay readers. This definitive history of music in the U.S. is sure to delight music aficionados and history buffs alike, and is a must for anyone interested in what music has meant to America and what America has meant to music.

To him, the U.S. was generally on track and would remain forever centrist. But all that has changed. <br><br>Over the past five years, a creeping extremism has taken hold of our federal government, which threatens to alter our system of governing ourselves and our national character. This extremism is neither liberal nor conservative, but is driven by the Bush administration's radical theories of executive power. Greenwald writes that we cannot abide these unlimited and unchecked presidential powers if we are to remain a constitutional republic. Because when you answer to no one, you're not a president &#x2014; you're a despot. <br><br>This is one man's story of being galvanized into action to defend his country, and his concise and penetrating analysis of what is at stake for America when its president has secretly bestowed upon himself the powers of a king. <br><br>From 9/11 to the question of nuclear war in Iran, Greenwald shows how Bush's claims of unlimited power play out. In the spirit of the colonists who once mustered the strength to denounce a king, Greenwald asks: how would a patriot act today?</p><p>Glenn Greenwald is a Constitutional law attorney, and author of the political blog, &#34;Unclaimed Territory.&#34; Greenwald has written for American Conservative magazine and appeared on a variety of television and radio programs, including C-Span&#39;s &#34;Washington Journal,&#34; Air America&#39;s &#34;Majority Report&#34; and Public Radio International&#39;s &#34;To the Point.&#34; His reporting and analysis have been credited in The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Salon, Slate and a variety of other print and online publications.</p><h2>Hundred Dollar Holiday: The Case For A More Joyful Christmas</h2><p>Too many people have come to dread the approach of the holidays, a season that should -- and can -- be the most relaxed, intimate, joyful, and spiritual time of the year. In this book, Bill McKibben offers some suggestions on how to rethink Christmastime, so that our current obsession with present-buying becomes less important than the dozens of other possible traditions and celebrations. <br> Working through their local churches, McKibben and his colleagues found that people were hungry for a more joyful Christmas season. For many, trying to limit the amount of money they spent at Christmas to about a hundred dollars per family, was a real spur to their creativity -- and a real anchor against the relentless onslaught of commercials and catalogs that try to say Christmas is only Christmas if it comes from a store. <br> McKibben shows how the store-bought Christmas developed and how out of tune it is with our current lives, when we're really eager for family fellowship for community involvement, for contact with the natural world, and also for the blessed silence and peace that the season should offer. McKibben shows us how to return to a simpler and more enjoyable holiday. <br> Christmas is too wonderful a celebration to give up on, too precious a time simply to repeat the same empty gestures from year to year. This book will serve as a road map to a Christmas far more joyful than the ones you've known in the past.</p><p>This brief, eloquently presented book offers a simple and inviting strategy for handling the most complicated holiday of our times--Christmas. Reacting to the commercialization and overspending that has come to define it, author Bill McKibben (<i>The End of Nature</i>) argues in favor of only spending a hundred dollars at Christmas. Rather than grousing about the deterioration of Christmas, McKibben matter-of-factly explains that there was a time that giving extravagant presents may have been a satisfying and meaningful ritual. "The Christmas we now celebrate grew up at a time when Americans were mostly poor ... mostly working with their hands and backs," he writes. If we now feel burdened and unsatisfied by the piles of gifts and overconsuming, it is not because Christmas has changed all that much, he adds, "It's because we have."<p> What we need and long for now are the gifts of time, meaningful family connections, periods of silence, a relationship with the divine, McKibben writes. How to give and receive the Christmas gifts that matters? Make homemade presents (he even offers a chapter's worth of great ideas). Give children coupons for zoo visits or an evening devoted to playing board games. It's likely that McKibben, a former staff writer for <i>The New Yorker,</i> could launch a national movement with this inviting and sensible concept. But no matter how many dollars you spend, factor the cost of this book into your Christmas budget! <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Bill McKibben is the bestselling author of <i>The End of Nature, The Age of Missing Information,</i> and <i>The Comforting Whirlwind: God, Job, and the Scale of Creation.</i> A former staff writer for <i>The New Yorker,</i> he lives in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York.</p><h2>The Elements of the Qabalah</h2><p>The Qabalah is a practical system for understading ourselves and our relationship with our world.

The Society of Biblical Literature recently ended the work of a group devoted to the study of Paul&#39;s theology. We are now seeing the publication of a number of books from various points of view that are examining the life, thought, and influence of the apostle Paul. Despite this recent attention to Paul&#39;s thought, J. Louis Martyn believes that insufficient attention has been paid to the discovery of numerous and pervasive apocalyptic themes in Paul&#39;s letters. Further, says Martyn, Paul is still being studied somewhat in isolation, almost as though he had had neither comrades nor competitors. One of the results is that Paul is sometimes credited with views he did not hold--views which were, in fact, held by his opponents. In Theological Issues in the Letters of Paul we find the results of a lifetime of study of Paul&#39;s letters by a well-known and widely respected New Testament scholar. &#34;This volume presents highly significant Pauline insights by one of the most perceptive and innovative New Testament scholars of our time.&#34;--Raymond E. Brown, Union Theological Seminary, New York &#34;No American in our generation has done as much to map the terrain of Pauline theology as has J. Louis Martyn.

He traveled through Spain, France, and Morocco,finally settling in Paris, where he obtained a residency in the Cite des Arts. Upon his return to New York, Moore began a decade-long involvement with modern dance, theater, film, and video that paralleled his development as a painter. The increasing devastation of the AIDS crisis through the eighties profoundly and irrevocably transformed his life and work. His work was included in the 1995 Whitney Biennial and is included in the collections of the Whitney Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Albright Knox Art Gallery.</p><p>Science and nature live in a sometimes indelicate balance in the rueful, sexual, and often disturbing work of American artist Frank Moore, who died in New York City in April 2002 on the cusp of worldwide acclaim. <i>Between Life &amp; Death</i> is the breathtaking, oversized first monograph on the life's work of this artist who battled AIDS (and often the medical establishment) for 20 years.<p> Moore had a lifelong interest in art and science, but it was his exploration into surrealism while on a long residency in Paris that truly informed his art, allowing these divergent images to coexist so harmoniously. The increasing devastation of the worldwide AIDS crisis throughout the 1980s profoundly and irrevocably changed Moore's life as well as his work. Personal losses began to affect his work: health and ecology merged as a triumphant theme in most of these 73 paintings, many of which can be seen in some of the world's most important museums and galleries.</p><p> Beautifully designed and printed, <i>Between Life &amp; Death</i> is a fitting tribute to this artist who both painted about his time and pointed to problems of our time. As Robert Gl�ck writes in his foreword, "Wonder can be a form of activism. Moore develops a language of wonder, foursquare, wide-eyed. He paints his subjects with a highly controlled palette: the modulation of warm and cool blues. Mary's mantle is the blue of contemplation; <i>Der Blaue Reiter</i> is the blue of mystical nature; Miles Davis's <i>Kind of Blue</i> is a still lake of sound. I think Moore's blue is the color of our dear planet, our bright organism, a blue of compassion and wonder." --<i>Charles Decker</i></p>Poet, fiction writer, editor, and New Narrative theorist Robert Gluck has served as director of San Francisco State&#39;s Poetry Center, codirector of the Small Press Traffic Literary Center, and editor for Lapis Press and the literary journal &#34;Narrativity&#34;.

Much more than simple principles and platitudes, the book takes readers on an inspiring spiritual journey to find their true and deepest self and reach the ultimate in personal growth and spirituality: the discovery of truth and light. In the first chapter, Tolle introduces readers to enlightenment and its natural enemy, the mind. He awakens readers to their role as a creator of pain and shows them how to have a pain-free identity by living fully in the present. The journey is thrilling, and along the way, the author shows how to connect to the indestructible essence of our Being, &#39;&#39;the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death.&#39;&#39; Featuring a new preface by the author, this paperback shows that only after regaining awareness of Being, liberated from Mind and intensely in the Now, is there Enlightenment.</p><p>Ekhart Tolle's message is simple: living in the <i>now</i> is the truest path to happiness and enlightenment. And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle's clear writing, supportive voice, and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who's ever wondered what exactly "living in the now" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.<p> Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into <i>The Power of Now</i>. (Topics include the source of Chi, enlightened relationships, creative use of the mind, impermanence, and the cycle of life.) Thankfully, he's added markers that symbolize "break time." This is when readers should close the book and mull over what they just read.

Introduction<p></p> <br>Angel: I have something to say&#x2014;<br> <br>George: Hold on. I&#x2019;m not finished.<br> <br>Angel: What I am trying to say&#x2014;<br> <br>George: See and this is what I&#x2019;m talking about&#x2014;<br> <br>Angel: Right, I know, because I do not&#x2014;<br> <br>George: You cut in&#x2014;<br> <br>Angel: I have to say something now&#x2014;<br> <br>George: No. Because when you cut in&#x2014;<br> <br>Angel: I have something to say here.<br> <br>George: SHUT UP!<br> <br>Angel and George were newlyweds juggling long work hours while raising two toddlers. That&#x2019;s a situation tough enough to put pressure on any marriage, but you wouldn&#x2019;t need a background in research psychology to recognize that this one was in trouble. The dialogue above is a snippet of the argument they had in my research lab. They sparred without end over who worked harder, who did more housework and who said what when. Angel and George, like many embattled couples, gave up on their marriage and divorced. This outcome was not unexpected considering how damaged their relationship was. When I met with them, they could barely look at each other without scowling and rolling their eyes.<br> <br>For years I have invited couples like Angel and George to take part in experiments at my &#x201c;Love Lab,&#x201d; the media&#x2019;s nickname for the facility at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I subject long-term romance to scientific scrutiny. In a typical study I analyze couples while they converse about everyday topics as well as when they argue. I interview them together and individually. I&#x2019;ve even observed couples while they spend an entire day at the Love Lab&#x2019;s studio apartment, which comes complete with sofa, loveseat, TV, kitchen, a lake view, and video cameras hooked to the walls, which record every moment of their interactions. (The bathroom, of course, is off limits.) Thanks to these studies, I have accumulated nearly four decades&#x2019; worth of data&#x2014;a library of how and what partners say to and about each other, and their physiological reactions. These days I also conduct similar exercises with couples who are not part of any study but wish to receive a scientific assessment of their relationship&#x2019;s staying power.<br> <br>When couples like Angel and George enter the Love Lab, we hook them up to enough sensors and wires to elicit quips about Dr. Frankenstein. While they adjust to the equipment and their surroundings, information begins to stream from the sensors, indicating their blood velocities, heart and pulse rates, the amount their palms sweat, and even how much they squirm in their chairs. A video camera records all of their words and body movements. On the other side of a one-way mirror, my assistants, surrounded by equipment readouts, and the requisite collection of empty cola cans, scrutinize the subtle interplay between the couple&#x2019;s biological reactions, body language, facial expressions, and words.<br> <br>The most frequent experiment I conduct is called the conflict discussion, in which we ask the couple to converse about an area of disagreement for fifteen minutes. To facilitate the analysis of their facial expressions during their disputes, I train a separate video camera on each of them so I can view their faces in real time on a split screen.<br> <br>It no longer surprises me when our couples are able to relax and &#x201c;let it rip&#x201d; despite the staring cameras. Still, I find that most people do curb their behavior in the lab compared to when they squabble at home. But even when partners are acting &#x201c;camera ready,&#x201d; they can&#x2019;t hide from the accuracy of my sensors.<br> <br>Close analysis of so many couples over the years led me to formulate seven key principles that can improve the odds of maintaining a positive relationship. Described in The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, they emphasize the value of friendship between partners, accepting each other&#x2019;s influence, and being gentle during disagreements. These fundamentals remain a powerful tool set for all relationships. But the sad fate of couples like Angel and George indicated to me that these principles did not reach deep enough to salvage many damaged romances. I could not accept that these partners were somehow fated to be losers at love. To aid these despairing couples, I needed to better understand what was going wrong between them.<br> <br>Perhaps what puzzled me most about the unhappy couples I studied or counseled was their sincere insistence that they were deeply in love and committed to their relationship&#x2014;even as they were ordering each other to &#x201c;shut up&#x201d; in the Love Lab. Why did so many self-proclaimed devoted couples engage in constant warfare? It made no sense. They derived no relationship benefits from their quarrels. They reported more distress over fighting than did happy couples&#x2014;and yet they went at it more often.<br> <br>It would be easy to assume that the unhappy couples argued more than others because, well, they disagreed more. What could be more logical? But as a scientist, I know that &#x201c;obvious&#x201d; conclusions are not always accurate. In my lab, computer scientist Dr. Tara Madyhastha helped me find the answer. To trace the anatomy of interactions between unhappy partners, she used what are called &#x201c;hidden Markov models.&#x201d; These types of computer analyses, often implemented to decode languages or DNA sequences, can detect underlying patterns. Her results indicated that couples who seem to act like adversaries rather than lovers are trapped by what is known, in technical terms, as an absorbing state of negativity. This means the probability that they will enter the state is greater than the odds that they will exit it. In other words, they get stuck. These unlucky partners are imprisoned in a roach motel for lovers: They check in, but they can&#x2019;t check out. Consumed by negativity, their relationships die there.<br> <br>Understanding why some couples wind up in this terrible trap while others are able to sidestep it has been at the heart of my recent research. As a result, I have developed a new understanding of couple dynamics and an enhanced approach to bettering all romantic relationships&#x2014;not just the ones in distress.<br> <br>If you listened to trapped couples argue in my lab, you would hear a litany of complaints that wouldn&#x2019;t seem to have much in common. Tim grouses that Jane cares more about her mother&#x2019;s opinion than his. Alexis keeps stalling on starting a family, to the frustration of her husband. Jimmy doesn&#x2019;t like it that Pat wants to switch churches. But when I speak to these unhappy partners, I am struck by an underlying similarity. They are all talking (or shouting) past each other or not even bothering to communicate at all. Despite their commitment to sticking it out, they have lost something fundamental between lovers, a quality often termed &#x201c;magic&#x201d; or &#x201c;passion,&#x201d; that exists at a primitive, &#x201c;animal&#x201d; level. That&#x2019;s why they end up in the roach motel.<br> <br>I now know that a specific poison deprives couples of this precious &#x201c;something&#x201d; and drives them into relentless unhappiness. It is a noxious invader, arriving with great stealth, undermining a seemingly stable romance until it may be too late. You&#x2019;ll think at first that I&#x2019;m stating the obvious when I tell you that the name of this toxin is betrayal. I recognize that some of the harm wrought by betrayal is common knowledge. We face a constant onslaught of tabloid &#x201c;gotcha!&#x201d; stories about celebrities and politicians with sex addictions and broken marriage vows. These morality tales of distrust and disloyalty underline how common and devastating infidelity can be. Yet I have good reason for calling betrayal a &#x201c;secret&#x201d; relationship killer. The disloyalty is not always expressed through a sexual affair. It more often takes a form that couples do not recognize as infidelity. In my lab, partners will insist that despite their troubles they have been faithful to each other. But they are wrong. Betrayal is the secret that lies at the heart of every failing relationship&#x2014;it is there even if the couple is unaware of it. If a husband always puts his career ahead of his relationship, that is betrayal. When a wife keeps breaking her promise to start a family, that is also betrayal. Pervasive coldness, selfishness, unfairness, and other destructive behaviors are also evidence of disloyalty and can lead to consequences as equally devastating as adultery.<br> <br>Despite how dangerous and widespread betrayal is, I can offer couples hope. By analyzing the anatomy of this poison, I have figured out how to defeat it. I now know that there is a fundamental principle for making relationships work that serves as an antidote to unfaithfulness. That principle is trust. Once again it might sound like I&#x2019;m trumpeting the obvious! Happy couples tell me all the time that mutual trust is what lets them feel safe with each other, deepens their love, and allows friendship and sexual intimacy to blossom. Unhappy partners complain that their relationship lacks this element. But all couples tend to think of trust as an intangible quality that can&#x2019;t be pinned down or measured in a concrete way. In fact, it is now possible to calculate a couple&#x2019;s trust and betrayal levels mathematically and subject them to scientific study. This new analytical approach allows me to identify a couple&#x2019;s strengths and vulnerabilities, and to devise strategies that can rescue miserable relationships from the roach motel and keep others from going there.<br> <br>In addition to benefitting couples, this new understanding of trust and betrayal has profound cultural implications. It has become commonplace for us to increase the complexity of our lives until we almost reach the breaking point. With our emails, cell phones, and intricate juggling of responsibilities, we live on the edge of a catastrophic stress response. We each have our own &#x201c;carrying capacity&#x201d; for stress and tend to pile it on till we come just shy of overload. Headlines that hawk &#x201c;stress cures&#x201d; are rife on the internet, on newsstands, and in bookstores. But I believe trust is the greatest stress buster of all.<br> <br>In relationships where there is a high potential for betrayal, people waste time and emotional energy. Whether the fear concerns adultery or other faithlessness, suspicious people act like detectives or prosecuting attorneys, interrogating their partners, looking for verification that their insecurity is justified. Decision making becomes exhaustive and exhausting: If I go out of town, will he leave the kids with that babysitter I don&#x2019;t trust? If I check her closet, am I going to find new clothes despite our austerity budget? Should I risk confrontation by checking out his story? One man who suspected his wife of cheating put chalk marks on her rear tires before he left for work one morning. Later, when he discovered that the chalk marks were no longer visible, indicating the car wheels had turned, he asked whether she had left the house. Forgetting about her morning dash to the post office, she said no. This prompted a jealous rage, which put both of their stress levels into hyperdrive.<br> <br>In sharp contrast, trust removes an enormous source of stress because it allows you to act with incomplete information. You don&#x2019;t subject your mind and body to constant worry, so the complexity of your decision making plummets. You don&#x2019;t need to put chalk on tires or otherwise test your partner. Implicit trust saves you a lot of time and leaves you free to grapple with less tumultuous concerns.<br> <br>I always strive to increase the understanding of long-term relationships and to help couples navigate their way to happier and healthier romance. Still, I know that not all relationships can, or should, survive betrayal. Even when a long-term partnership ends for good reason, the shattered faith in love can be devastating. The loss must be acknowledged and confronted before moving on. If you are recovering from a breakup, the findings and exercises in the pages ahead may offer a deeper understanding of what went wrong and help prepare you to try again with somebody new.<br> <br>Charting a way forward after a deep wound is just as important as learning to make a relationship work. If your last relationship failed, you may fear trusting someone again. But this wariness can leave you vulnerable to lifelong and profound loneliness. This isolation has not only serious psychological repercussions but physical ones as well. By fine-tuning your radar for deception, this book can help you develop the courage, strength, and wisdom to search for a trustworthy partner.<br> <br>Throughout my career I have met skeptics who do not believe that sensors, computers, video cameras, and other lab equipment can assess something as mysterious and seemingly indefinable as love.

Twelve distinguished historians from many countries examine the image of women in the masculine mind, their social condition, and their daily experience from the demise of the Roman Empire to the genesis of the Italian Renaissance. </p><p> More than in any other era, a medieval woman's place in society was determined by men; her sexuality was perceived as disruptive and dangerous, her proper realm that of the home and cloister. The authors draw upon the writings of bishops and abbots, moralists and merchants, philosophers and legislators, to illuminate how men controlled women's lives. Sumptuary laws regulating feminine dress and ornament, pastoral letters admonishing women to keep silent and remain chaste, and learned treatises with their fantastic theories about women's physiology are fully explored in these pages. As adoration of the Virgin Mary reached full flower by the year 1200, ecclesiastics began to envision motherhood as a holy role; misogyny, however, flourished unrestrained in local proverbs, secular verses, and clerical thought throughout the period. </p><p> Were women's fates sealed by the dictates of church and society? The authors investigate legal, economic, and demographic aspects of family and communal life between the sixth and the fifteenth centuries and bring to light the fleeting moments in which women managed to seize some small measure of autonomy over their lives. The notion that courtly love empowered feudal women is discredited in this volume. The pattern of wear on a hearthstone, fingerprints on a terra-cotta pot, and artifacts from everyday life such as scissors, thimbles, spindles, and combs are used to reconstruct in superb detail the commonplace tasks that shaped women's existence inside and outside the home. As in antiquity, male fantasies and fears are evident in art. Yet a growing number of women rendered visions of their own gender in sumptuous tapestries and illuminations. The authors look at the surviving texts of female poets and mystics and document the stirrings of a quiet revolution throughout the West, as a few daring women began to preserve their thoughts in writing. </p></p><p><b> Georges Duby</b>, a member of the Acad�mie Fran�aise, is Professor of Medieval History at the Coll�ge de France.This five-volume work addresses the history of women from the ancients to the 1980s. Editors George Duby et al. state that this series of books "is the product of a revolutionAan ongoing, far-reaching revolution in the relations between men and women in Western societies." It therefore focuses on the western European experience with some attention to North America and "is intended to be not so much a history of women as a history of the relation between the sexes" because that is "the crux of the problem, the source of women's identity and otherness." <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>William Cooper&#39;s Town: Power and Persuasion on the Frontier of the Early American Republic</h2><p>A Pulitzer Prize-winning story of a frontier village in the early American Republic. With 16 pages of photographs, 7 maps, and 17 tables.</p><p>In 1786 William Cooper, determined to become a self-made gentleman of substance in post-revolutionary America, founded Cooperstown, N.Y., through a dodgy land deal. His town rose to become county seat, and Cooper became a judge and then a congressman. He lost most of the prestige he earned later, when he overstretched himself, and his local patronage weakened when he backed the Federalists against the victorious Republicans. Nonetheless, his son, James Fenimore Cooper, the early 19th century's best-selling novelist, wrote essentially a justification of his father in his third novel, The Pioneers (1823). Taylor's book--a combination of biography, personal history, social history, literary exegesis and analysis of father-son dynamics--charts the interplay between the fact and the fiction of the days when upstate New York was the frontier. <b> William Cooper's Town</b> won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for history.&#34;Marvelous....Taylor&#39;s intellectual grasp never fails.&#34;--The New Yorker</p><h2>Tired of Trying to Measure Up</h2><p>Written to point the way to freedom for Christians who live under an unwritten religious code of expectations and rules that drain them of spiritual strength.</p><p>Are you always trying hard, but feel like it's never good enough?<br> <br>Tired of Trying to Measure Up is written for Christians who live under a deeply ingrained code of expectations and rules that shame them and drain them of spiritual strength.<br>Do you wonder:<br> <br>* Why do I feel so guilty?<br>* Why is it so hard to rest, even when I know I need to?<br>* Why does my religious activity leave me unfulfilled?<br>* Where's the "abundant life" God promised?<br> <br>If these questions sound familiar, this book is for you. It won't teach you how to change your behavior or try harder. If trying hard was the key to the victorious Christian life, you'd probably be in the hall of fame by now, don't you think? This is a message to help you unmask the lies that keep you on the works treadmill and to help you discover the liberation of the gospel of grace in Jesus Christ and the rest that comes through the cross.<br> <br>When there's more emphasis on doing right than knowing God and His grace, this book points the way to freedom.Jeff VanVonderen is a highly sought after speaker and consultant both nationally and internationally.

There was only the faint roar of the fire in the distance.Sonon pulled his black cape more tightly around him and studied the frozen ground. The warriors' feet had hewn a dark swath through the frost that glittered in the gaudy orange halo. His gaze followed their trail to the burning village. The Dawnland People had called it Bog Willow Village. Yesterday it had contained over one hundred houses.He hadn't expected the village to be this bad.As he walked toward it, ash fell around him like fine flakes of obsidian, coating his cape and long hair, turning them gray. The forty-hand-tall palisade that surrounded the village had burned through in too many places. That had been their doom. They must have watched in horror as the enemy streamed through those gaps and raced across the village, killing everything in their path.He turned back around to stare at the victory camp. Hundreds of celebrating warriors danced to the sound of drums and flutes. Most were from the Flint or Mountain Peoples, but the war party had contained a few Hills People warriors, too. He knew them from their distinctive tattoos, and the designs painted on their bows and capes.On the far side of the camp, near the river, captive women and children huddled together, shivering, watching their captors with wide stunned eyes. Before dawn came all would be sold and marched away to enemy villages. The lucky ones would be adopted into families and spend the rest of their lives trying to forget this night. The others wouldn't have to worry about it.Sonon took a breath and let it out slowly.There were still times when he woke to the sound of screams that existed only inside him. For many summers he'd thought they were the cries of his twin sister, and he'd been ravaged by guilt. When he'd finally realized the voice was his own, the pain had eased a little. The day they were sold into slavery, he'd seen only eight summers. He wasn't a warrior. There was nothing he could have done to save her--or himself.He clenched his fists so hard his nails bit into his palms. He had to go down there, into the village. No man wished to admit he was afraid, but ...He forced his legs to walk. At first, only a few bodies lay alongside the trail, but as he neared the palisade the number increased. Desperate villagers must have fought to get outside and run headlong into a line of waiting archers. Bodies, bristling with arrows, had piled up around each gap in the defensive wall. The last few to make it outside probably had to shove their way through a mound of dead.Sonon carefully stepped around the carnage and ducked through the charred hole in the palisade. The heat struck him first. He threw up an arm and squinted against the glare to see what remained of Bog Willow Village. In less than twenty heartbeats he was sweating, struggling for air. The smoke was so thick it was almost impossible to breathe.Five paces away an old woman sat on the ground with her face in her hands, rocking back and forth in dazed silence. A few other survivors stumbled past. They moved methodically, searching for loved ones or bending to collect precious belongings: a dropped pot or basket, children's toys.<i>I'm over here. See me?</i>Sonon stopped, and tiny tornadoes of ash spun away from his sandals. They whirled through the firelit shadows. Was it just his fatigue? It sounded like a boy's voice.Cautiously, he veered around a collapsed wall and began searching the debris. Twenty paces later, he almost stumbled over the child.Two small arms extended from beneath a buckled wall.Sonon knelt and pulled the boy from the heap of smoldering bark. Most of his hair had been singed off. He'd seen perhaps six or seven summers. For a time, he just held the boy in his lap and listened to the crackling roar of the fire. Somewhere in the conflagration, muted voices shouted names ... and went unanswered. Occasionally, orphaned children darted by.When he could, he staggered to his feet and carried the boy between the burning husks of two houses, then stepped through a gap in the palisade wall and trudged down to the river's edge, where he gently rested the boy on the shore. In the wavering glare, the boy's half-open eyes seemed to be alive and watching him.<i>Why do I only hear them when the struggle is over? Are the voices of the dead only audible to those trapped in eternal night?</i>Sonon tenderly adjusted the boy's cape, pulling it up around his throat to keep him warm. "It's all right," he said. "I'll make sure they find you. Your clan will take care of you, and you'll have no trouble crossing the bridge to the afterlife. Your ancestors will be waiting for you."Though he was a man of the Hills nation, he knew the ways of the Dawnland People. They believed that the unburied dead became Ghost Fires, angry fire-beings that could not cross the bridge to the afterlife and were forever doomed to remain around the deteriorating bones. The Bog Willow Village survivors would not leave their beloved relatives to that terrible fate, not if they could help it. That meant someone would come looking for this child. His body would be ritually cleaned and prepared for the long journey; then his family would sing him to the afterlife. Having the boy out here in the open would make it easier for his relatives to find him.Sonon wiped his soot-coated face with the back of his hand and looked out across the river to the opposite, willow-choked bank. Beyond it, towering black spruces caught the reflections in the water and seemed made of translucent amber wings. The river itself, coated with ash, had an opaque leaden sheen.He stood up and turned back to the village. For ten heartbeats, he just breathed and studied the palisade. People from distant places did not understand that each log was a Standing Warrior. Among their peoples, the angry souls of dead warriors were excluded from the Land of the Dead, so they moved into trees. They remained in the wood for centuries, until the tree disintegrated and their souls were forced toseek new homes. It was these trees that the People cut down to make their palisades. That meant that every log was a warrior still keeping guard, still protecting his or her people.He wondered what the Standing Warriors must be feeling. Not so long ago, they'd watched this little boy racing happily across the plaza, seen him playing ball and dish games with his friends, heard his laughter ringing through the village on quiet summer afternoons. Their grief must be unbearable.Sonon whispered, "No one could have held off such an assault. It wasn't your fault. You did the best you--"Voices drifted from the river. He turned.A birch-bark canoe quietly slipped through the smoke, parting the river like an arrow, heading south. An old woman rode in the bow. She was dressed like a man and wore a long black wig, but a few greasy twists of gray hair stuck out around the edges, framing her deeply wrinkled face. Even if she hadn't been in disguise, he would have known her. A thousand summers from now, as he walked the earth alone, he would hear her footsteps in his nightmares.Four children lay together in her canoe, crying. Three warriors with paddles swiftly drove them forward. Close on the heels of the first, another canoe pierced the darkness--with three more captive children.As the canoes passed, waves rippled outward and washed up on the shore near the dead boy, leaving delicate ribbons of firelit foam at his feet.Everything about tonight felt strange and surreal. As though Sonon was locked in a trance and could not wake, his heart thumped a dull staccato against his chest.At least a few of the children had escaped. Earlier in the evening, he'd helped them ... as much as he could.When the canoes vanished into the darkness, he looked at the western mountains. He couldn't see the pass through the smoke and falling ash. The trail the escaped children had taken was the fastest way back to the lands of the People of the Standing Stone. But there would be many others on that trail: survivors of the village slaughter, orphaned children, and a few wary men who'd left the victory camp early, trying to beat the onslaught of warriors who would crowd the trail just after dawn.Very softly he called, "Stay strong, Odion, and you'll be all right. You'll--"<i>I'm here. Right here. Please find me?</i>Sonon squeezed his eyes closed for several long moments. It was a girl's voice.He clenched his fists again; then he tramped back up the hill, ducked through the gap in the palisade, and trotted into the roaring inferno to search for her.Copyright � 2011 by Kathleen O'Neal Gear and W.

Many current themes are discussed, including meditation, nature, established religion, race relations, karma and reincarnation, astrology and tantric yoga, and the nature of ecstasy, but the underlying motif is the art of feeling out and following the watercourse way of nature, known in Chinese as the Tao. Watts suggests a way of contemplative meditation in which we temporarily stop naming and classifying all that we experience, and simply feel it as it is.Alan W.

Edvard grows up on a remote mountain farmstead in Norway with his taciturn grandfather, Sverre. The death of his parents, when he was three years old, has always been shrouded in mystery - he has never been told how or where it took place and has only a distant memory of his mother. But he knows that the fate of his grandfather&#39;s brother, Einar, is somehow bound up with this mystery. One day a coffin is delivered for his grandfather long before his death - a meticulous, beautiful piece of craftsmanship. Perhaps Einar is not dead after all. Edvard&#39;s desperate quest to unlock the family&#39;s tragic secrets takes him on a long journey - from Norway to the Shetlands, and to the battlefields of France - to the discovery of a very unusual inheritance. The Sixteen Trees of the Somme is about the love of wood and finding your own self, a beautifully intricate and moving tale that spans an entire century. Translated from the Norwegian by Paul Russell Garrett</p><p>Lars Mytting, a novelist and journalist, was born in Favang, Norway, in 1968. His novel Svom med dem som drukner (to be published in English as The Sixteen Trees of the Somme) was awarded the Norwegian National Booksellers&#39; Award and has been bought for film. Norwegian Wood has become an international bestseller, and was the Bookseller Industry Awards Non-Fiction Book of the Year 2016.Though the twists of discovery drive the plot, it is the intimacy with the natural world - as we might expect from the author of the phenomenally successful Norwegian Wood - that most compels us: potato-flowers, islets, storm petrels, walnut trees and walnut wood. -- Paul Binding * Times Literary Supplement * The tug of this book on the heart and mind is irresistible . . . And you will, I think, struggle to find a modern novel in which the emotional, imaginative lure of trees and wood is as powerful. -- Michael Duggan * Catholic Herald Books of the Year. * The Sixteen Trees of the Somme is so cleverly plotted, and it builds up such effortless dramatic momentum as it zeroes in on its conclusion -- Roger Cox * Scotsman * Mytting follows up Norwegian Wood with a mystery that fits together like a piece of fine marquetry -- Christian House * Observer * Mytting&#39;s book is as much a romantic historical thriller as it is a book of promise, a page-turner as it is a reflective journey into selfhood, history, life&#39;s meaning and individual moral responsibility -- Mika Provata-Carlone * Bookanista *</p><h2>Free Enterprise: An American History</h2><p><b>An incisive look at the intellectual and cultural history of free enterprise and its influence on American politics</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout the twentieth century, &#x201c;free enterprise&#x201d; has been a contested keyword in American politics, and the cornerstone of a conservative philosophy that seeks to limit government involvement into economic matters. Lawrence B. Glickman shows how the idea first gained traction in American discourse and was championed by opponents of the New Deal. Those politicians, believing free enterprise to be a fundamental American value, held it up as an antidote to a liberalism that they maintained would lead toward totalitarian statism. Tracing the use of the concept of free enterprise, Glickman shows how it has both constrained and transformed political dialogue. He presents a fascinating look into the complex history, and marketing, of an idea that forms the linchpin of the contemporary opposition to government regulation, taxation, and programs such as Medicare.</p><p><b>Lawrence B. Glickman</b> is Stephen and Evalyn Milman Professor of American Studies in the department of history at Cornell University. He has published several books, including <i>Buying Power: A History of Consumer Activism in America.</i>&#x201c;[Glickman] effectively highlights the ways in which the future of free enterprise was, to its supporters, always under threat.&#x201d;&#x2014;Matthew Rees, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>"A remarkable work of scholarship. It reflects a deep immersion in a wide range of sources that have rarely if ever been brought together.

Prosecutors now decide whom to punish and how severely. Almost no one accused of a crime will ever face a jury. Inconsistent policing, rampant plea bargaining, overcrowded courtrooms, and ever more draconian sentencing have produced a gigantic prison population, with black citizens the primary defendants and victims of crime. In this passionately argued book, the leading criminal law scholar of his generation looks to history for the roots of these problems&#x2015;and for their solutions.</p><p><i>The Collapse of American Criminal Justice</i> takes us deep into the dramatic history of American crime&#x2015;bar fights in nineteenth-century Chicago, New Orleans bordellos, Prohibition, and decades of murderous lynching. Digging into these crimes and the strategies that attempted to control them, Stuntz reveals the costs of abandoning local democratic control. The system has become more centralized, with state legislators and federal judges given increasing power. The liberal Warren Supreme Court&#x2019;s emphasis on procedures, not equity, joined hands with conservative insistence on severe punishment to create a system that is both harsh and ineffective.</p><p>What would get us out of this Kafkaesque world? More trials with local juries; laws that accurately define what prosecutors seek to punish; and an equal protection guarantee like the one that died in the 1870s, to make prosecution and punishment less discriminatory. Above all, Stuntz eloquently argues, Americans need to remember again that criminal punishment is a necessary but terrible tool, to use effectively, and sparingly.</p></p><p>William J.

It was in this glittering capital of the international art world that, after suffering years of poverty and neglect, he emerged as the leader of a bohemian band of painters, sculptors, and poets. Fueled by opium and alcohol, inspired by raucous late-night conversations at the Lapin Agile cabaret, Picasso and his friends resolved to shake up the world.<br> <br>For most of these years Picasso lived and worked in a squalid tenement known as the Bateau Lavoir, in the heart of picturesque Montmartre. Here he met his first true love, Fernande Olivier, a muse whom he would transform in his art from Symbolist goddess to Cubist monster. These were years of struggle, often of desperation, but Picasso later looked back on them as the happiest of his long life.<br> <br>Recognition came slowly: first in the avant-garde circles in which he traveled, and later among a small group of daring collectors, including the Americans Leo and Gertrude Stein. In 1906, Picasso began the vast, disturbing masterpiece known as <i>Les Demoiselles d&#x2019;Avignon.</i> Inspired by the groundbreaking painting of Paul C�zanne and the startling inventiveness of African and tribal sculpture, Picasso created a work that captured and defined the disorienting experience of modernity itself. The painting proved so shocking that even his friends assumed he&#x2019;d gone mad. Only his colleague George Braque understood what Picasso was trying to do. Over the next few years they teamed up to create Cubism, the most revolutionary and influential movement in twentieth-century art.<br> <br>This is the story of an artistic genius with a singular creative gift. It is filled with heartbreak and triumph, despair and delirium, all of it played out against the backdrop of the world&#x2019;s most captivating city.</p><p>Miles J.

We were never truly happy except there.<br> <br>&#x2014;PICASSO TO ANDR� SALMON, 1945<br> <br>Pablo Picasso stood on the threshold of his apartment bundled against the autumn chill, his hat pulled low about his ears, a brown knit scarf tossed carelessly across his shoulders. A shapeless coat engulfed his stocky frame. Shabbily dressed, not so much anonymous as invisible beneath the layers, he hardly looked the part of the world&#x2019;s most famous artist.<br> <br>There was something incongruous in the scene, something about the man and the place that didn&#x2019;t quite match. If the elegant address&#x2014;a seventeenth-century apartment building on the rue des Grands-Augustins, in the genteel Left Bank neighborhood of Saint-Germain-des-Pr�s&#x2014;proclaimed his worldly success, his rumpled outfit suggested an indifference to the trappings that came with it. With his stained pants, worn at the cuff, and felt cap &#x201c;whose folds had long since given up the struggle for form,&#x201d; Picasso showed the same disregard for convention he had as a struggling painter living from hand to mouth in a squalid Montmartre tenement. It was a quirk of his personality that his first wife had tried hard to correct. She often complained that no matter how much money he made, he insisted on dressing like a bum. In fact, the wealthier he became, the more determined he was that money would not define him. &#x201c;One has to be able to afford luxury,&#x201d; he once explained to the writer Jean Cocteau, &#x201c;in order to be able to scorn it.&#x201d;<br> <br> <br>Picasso in the rue des Grands-Augustins. � RMN-Grand Palais / Art Resource, NY.<br><br>In any case it was not his wife he was waiting for this Tuesday afternoon in the fall of 1945. Olga had long since fallen by the wayside, a casualty of her unsuccessful battle to groom him for a life in high society. For a time he&#x2019;d submitted to her strict regime, attending costume balls hosted by the decadent Count �tienne de Beaumont, posing pipe in hand for the photographers, and generally playing the part of a debonair man-about-town. But he eventually tired of the cocktail parties and elegant soirees, reverting to the haphazard ways he&#x2019;d enjoyed before the smart set claimed him as one of their own. The Hungarian photographer Brassa�, who met Picasso in 1932, was on hand to observe the process: &#x201c;Those who thought that he had put his youth behind once and for all, forgotten the laughter and the farces of the early years, voluntarily abandoned his liberty and his pleasure in being with his friends, and allowed himself to be &#x2018;duped&#x2019; by the pursuit of &#x2018;status,&#x2019; found that they were mistaken. La vie de boh�me regained the upper hand.&#x201d; In truth, it had always been an unequal battle: while Olga tried to make him into a gentleman, he took revenge in his art by putting the former ballerina through a set of pictorial transformations, each more grotesque than the last.<br> <br>Rather than Olga&#x2014;or the voluptuous Marie-Th�r�se Walter or the brooding Dora Maar, former mistresses who were both still part of Picasso&#x2019;s extended harem&#x2014;the woman he was expecting this afternoon was his latest conquest, the twenty-four-year-old, auburn-haired Fran�oise Gilot.<br> <br>Perhaps conquest is not quite right. For once, it seemed, this relentless seducer had met his match. It&#x2019;s true that after a strenuous campaign Fran�oise had agreed to share his bed, but his attempts to possess her body and soul had been frustrated by her infuriating streak of independence. Her ability to parry his advances only increased his determination to have her, but her inscrutable ways drove him to distraction. Brassa� testified to the &#x201c;raw state of his nerves.&#x201d; With Fran�oise, this usually self-confident man (particularly when it came to the war between the sexes) was reduced to a gelatinous state. &#x201c;When I see Picasso, looking a little upset, shy as a college boy in love for the first time,&#x201d; Brassa� recalled, &#x201c;he gestures slightly toward Fran�oise, and says, &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t she pretty. Don&#x2019;t you think that she is beautiful?&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br> <br>Rue des Grands-Augustins. Courtesy of the author.<br><br> <br>Fran�oise Gilot. � Minist�re de la Culture / M�diath�que du Patrimoine, Dist. RMN-Grand Palais / Art Resource, NY.<br><br>There&#x2019;s no doubt that Fran�oise Gilot&#x2014;barely out of college and with little experience of the world in general, even less of men in particular&#x2014;managed to throw him off balance. After more than a year of on-and-off wooing, Picasso was still unsure where he stood. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand you,&#x201d; he grumbled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too complicated for me.&#x201d; In her most recent display of rebellion, Fran�oise had spent the last few months in the south of France, not exactly ending the relationship but making it clear that she wasn&#x2019;t ready to commit to him. And when she finally returned, showing up unexpectedly on his doorstep, he couldn&#x2019;t hide his hurt feelings. &#x201c;I thought you weren&#x2019;t coming back,&#x201d; he sulked, &#x201c;and that put me in a very black mood.&#x201d; Though she was here now, Picasso knew she might just as easily slip away.<br> <br>Since her return to Paris in late November, Picasso had assumed a role that had often worked before on star-struck young women, playing the older master to the eager pupil. Fran�oise had still not agreed to move in with him, but she visited his apartment almost every day. &#x201c;Over the weeks that followed,&#x201d; she recorded, &#x201c;I began to do just what Pablo advised me to do: to study Cubism more in depth. In the course of my studies and reflections I worked back to its roots and even beyond them to his early days in Paris, between 1904 and 1909.&#x201d; Being initiated into the mysteries of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most important movement by its founder was a rare privilege for a budding artist, and Picasso was happy to oblige. These lessons drew them closer, their intimacy heightened by the sense of a shared voyage. At the same time they measured an unbridgeable gap: while she had her future in front of her, he belonged to history.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>An older man&#x2014;Picasso had turned sixty-four this past October&#x2014;taking a young woman under his wing can generate a powerful sexual charge, and he was not above exploiting his fame to lure impressionable girls into his bed. But with Fran�oise it was different; he felt a kinship with her that went beyond mere sexual appetite. Each responded to the loneliness in the other, a sense of isolation that culminated in Picasso&#x2019;s fantasy that his lover would live in the rafters beneath the rooftop of his studio where, together, they could shut out the world. When Jaime Sabart�s&#x2014;the childhood friend who now served as his personal secretary and gatekeeper at the rue des Grands-Augustins&#x2014;warned him that the relationship was bound to end badly, Picasso turned on him angrily. &#x201c;You mind your business, Sabart�s,&#x201d; Picasso shouted. &#x201c;[W]hat you don&#x2019;t understand is . . . the fact that I like this girl.&#x201d; They were kindred spirits, he insisted, tormented souls who could find comfort only in each other&#x2019;s arms.<br> <br>Fran�oise was drawn to Picasso against her better judgment. Along with his famous charm, which he could turn on and off like a switch, he was bathed in the dazzling aura that surrounds all famous men. But there was more to his magnetism than this. Fran�oise was moved by Picasso&#x2019;s vulnerability, a vulnerability that showed through the hard shell of mistrust that served to shut out a world that had wounded him. He could be arrogant, insufferable, too certain of his genius, and merciless to anyone he thought was preventing him from realizing his destiny. There was also a desperate neediness, a sadness that played on her maternal instincts, instilling an almost irresistible urge to fix what was wrong, to make whole what had been broken.<br> <br>Still she held back, understanding instinctively that a relationship built around his all-consuming need was bound to be destructive. &#x201c;I could admire him tremendously as an artist,&#x201d; she remarked, &#x201c;but I did not want to become his victim or martyr.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Despite her youth, Gilot was no ingenue to satisfy the lust and prop up the vanity of an aging satyr (though as always in Picasso&#x2019;s case those two most compelling of human motives were never completely absent). Indeed, when he&#x2019;d spotted her two years earlier across the darkened room of his favorite restaurant, sitting with her childhood friend Genevi�ve, she&#x2019;d been introduced to him as &#x201c;the intelligent one&#x201d; to distinguish her from her &#x201c;beautiful&#x201d; companion.<br> <br>Of course, that was part of the problem. Fran�oise had a mind and a life of her own before she met Picasso. In May 1943 she had just made her professional debut with a show of paintings at the fashionable Madeleine Decr� gallery (in sharp contrast to Picasso himself, who had been labeled &#x201c;degenerate&#x201d; by the Nazi occupiers and whose work was banned from public exhibition). Noticing the two attractive women in the company of an actor he knew, Picasso sauntered over to their table bearing a bowl of ripe cherries, a luxury in wartime Paris that carried more than a faint erotic whiff. When Genevi�ve told him that she and her friend were painters, he burst out laughing. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the funniest thing I&#x2019;ve heard all day,&#x201d; he snorted. &#x201c;Girls who look like that can&#x2019;t be painters.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still, he&#x2019;d been sufficiently intrigued to pay an incognito visit to the gallery, and the following week, when Fran�oise took him up on his invitation to visit him in his studio, he remarked, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very gifted for drawing. . . . I think you should keep on working&#x2014;hard&#x2014;every day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Fran�oise was flattered by the great man&#x2019;s attention, but she had few illusions as to the nature of his interest. At first Picasso opted for the direct approach. On one occasion he pulled her roughly to him and planted a kiss on her lips; on another, he casually cupped her breasts like &#x201c;two peaches whose form and color had attracted him.&#x201d; Assuming he was merely trying to provoke her, Fran�oise determined that the best way to knock him off his game was by failing to play the role of the outraged virtue he expected. &#x201c;You do everything you can to make things difficult for me,&#x201d; he complained, dropping his hands. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t you at least pretend to be taken in, the way women usually do? If you don&#x2019;t fall in with my subterfuges, how are we ever going to get together?&#x201d;<br> <br>When Fran�oise finally relented, then, it was with eyes open, and even after they became lovers she was careful to retain room for maneuver, rebuffing his increasingly urgent pleas that she move in and tormenting him with what he described as her &#x201c;English reserve.&#x201d;<br> <br>Withholding a part of herself was an act of self-preservation. Fran�oise knew it was almost impossible to be intimate with Picasso without losing oneself entirely. Stronger women than she had been consumed in the furnace of his passion, an obsession whose intensity inevitably turned to disillusionment. &#x201c;For me,&#x201d; he told her, &#x201c;there are only two kinds of women&#x2014;goddesses and doormats.&#x201d; The idol inevitably fell, the object of worship becoming the focus of rage when she failed to vanquish the demons that haunted him. After the end of the wartime occupation he became increasingly unpredictable, lashing out angrily or wallowing in self-pity as his growing celebrity increased his sense of isolation. &#x201c;[H]e was very moody,&#x201d; Fran�oise recalled, &#x201c;one day brilliant sunshine, the next day thunder and lightning.&#x201d;<br> <br>For an older man, a consuming passion for an attractive woman young enough to be his granddaughter inevitably stirred up morbid thoughts of lost time, of the yawning chasm between his own vanished past, the inadequate present, and the uncertain future. As Picasso aged, the women he chose tended to get younger. His success in that arena reassured him that he retained the vital spirit that made him a force of nature, and any stumble conjured up the specter of his own mortality. In love, as in art, there were many pretenders to the throne, and if so far he had managed to stay on top, it remained a constant war against not only a host of rivals but also a more remorseless foe.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>When Fran�oise arrived at the rue des Grands-Augustins that Tuesday afternoon, she was surprised to find Picasso already waiting on the front steps. Usually he kept an eye out for her seated at the second-floor window, one of his pet pigeons perched familiarly on his shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take you to see the Bateau Lavoir,&#x201d; he announced, summoning like a talisman the name of the ramshackle tenement where he had spent his early years in Paris and where he had transformed himself from a young unknown to the acknowledged leader of the modern movement. &#x201c;I have to go see an old friend from those days who lives near there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before long, a car squeezed through the wrought-iron gate and inched into the courtyard, a jet black monstrosity&#x2014;half hearse, half royal chariot&#x2014;driven by a chauffer in white gloves and livery. This was Marcel at the wheel of Picasso&#x2019;s famous Hispano Suiza Coupe de Ville. The car was a relic from the days before the war, one of the few reminders Picasso allowed himself of his life with Olga: a souvenir of Parisian seasons filled with society balls and summers on the Riviera with Ernest Hemingway and the Fitzgeralds. Among the anachronistic touches were multiple interior mirrors for making the final adjustments to one&#x2019;s evening wear and crystal vases filled with cut flowers.<br> <br>It was a strange possession for someone who called himself a Communist, as odd as the grand and gloomy apartment that recalled a vanished aristocracy of minuets and powdered wigs. Since his headline-making announcement the year before that he was joining the &#x201c;People&#x2019;s Party,&#x201d; the chauffeured limousine had become something of an embarrassment, a visible symbol of hypocrisy. But for Picasso (who never learned to drive) the car was more than a luxury. It was a means of escape when the routines and the people associated with a particular place grew too burdensome. During the war years, with gasoline rationed and movement restricted by the Germans, he&#x2019;d been forced to abandon his peripatetic ways. Now, after years of claustrophobia and paranoia, he could once again travel at will, a necessary balm for his restless soul.<br> <br>The restlessness had always been there, but his kinetic energy used to take a different form. As a young man he had prowled Paris on foot, feeding his inspiration by feeding off the excitement of the vibrant city, wearing holes in shoes he couldn&#x2019;t afford to mend. It was not simply the last resort of a poor man; walking was a form of epistemology, a way of knowing. It provided the essential textures and materials of his art. The woman who lived with Picasso during his years of poverty remarked, &#x201c;[I]t is good to walk when you are young and carry hope in your heart.&#x201d; In meandering journeys through the neighborhoods of his adopted city he had time to think, to tease out the tangled skeins of his vision and explore new vistas and uncharted alleyways of the mind.

He spent his childhood in England and, at age eighteen, went to work for the Shell Oil Company in Africa. When World War II broke out, he joined the Royal Air Force and became a fighter pilot. At the age of twenty-six he moved to Washington, D.C., and it was there he began to write. His first short story, which recounted his adventures in the war, was bought by&nbsp;<i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, and so began a long and illustrious career.<br> <br> After establishing himself as a writer for adults, Roald Dahl began writing children&#x2019;s stories in 1960 while living in England with his family. His first stories were written as entertainment for his own children, to whom many of his books are dedicated.<br> <br> Roald Dahl is now considered one of the most beloved storytellers of our time. Although he passed away in 1990, his popularity continues to increase as his fantastic novels, including&nbsp;<i>James and the Giant Peach</i>,&nbsp;<i>Matilda</i>,&nbsp;<i>The BFG</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, delight an ever-growing legion of fans.<br> <br> Learn more about Roald Dahl on the official Roald Dahl Web site:&nbsp;<b>www.roalddahl.com</b>Imagine what would happen if a nervous young parson were re-afflicted with a peculiar strain of his childhood dyslexia, so that he unknowingly pronounced backwards only the most significant word in every sentence. In the fiendish hands of Roald Dahl, the parishioners must not only suffer the offense of praising Dog, but when the unsuspecting vicar attempts to compliment a group of little old ladies on the fact that each of them knits , his actual words incite chaos. Written for the benefit of the Dyslexia Institute in London, this slight book employs a host of jocular (though sometimes vulgar) malaprops to accentuate the beleaguered parson's condition. Blake's daffy illustrations have long captured the outrageous humor of Dahl's text, and this collaboration proves no exception. Of special interest is the illustrator's touching tribute at the end of the book, both to the late author's talent and to his "passionate belief in the importance of reading," which inspired this, his last book.

Boorstin describes a post-Civil War America united not by ideological conviction or religious faith but by common participation in ordinary living: "A new civilization found new ways of holding men together--less and less by creed or belief, by tradition or by place, more and more by common effort and common experience, by the apparatus of daily life, by their ways of thinking about themselves." This is not a familiar litany of names, dates, and places, but an anecdotal account that rises far above impressionism and paints a compelling portrait of the United States as it climbed to new heights. Sheer reading pleasure for lovers of history, this fittingly ambitious conclusion to the Americans trilogy won the Pulitzer Prize when it was first published in 1973. <i>--John J.

Chibis&#x2014;characters that range from hypercute miniature people to bizarrely sexy furry characters&#x2014;come in all varieties, all roles, including chibi teenagers, faeries, schoolgirls, nurses, mermaids, devils, angels, and everything in between. Now Christopher Hart, the world's best-selling author of cartoon and drawing titles, shows readers exactly how to draw chibis, infusing them with personality and creating authentic costumes for them. Cute chibi-style monsters (small yet powerful), appealing cat-girls (humanlike, but with feline traits), superdeformed manga/chibi characters (used to make funny wisecracks)&#x2014;every type of chibi character is shown here in crystal clear, step-by-step drawings. <i>Manga Mania Chibi and Furry Characters</i> will get every manga fan in on the chibi fun.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HART is the world&#39;s bestselling author of drawing and cartooning books. His books have sold more than 7.4 million copies and have been translated into 20 languages. Renowned for up-to-the-minute content and easy-to-follow steps, all of Hart&#39;s books have become staples for a new generation of aspiring artists and professionals, and they have been selected by the American Library Association for special notice.Grade 5 Up For those not familiar with <i>chibi</i>, this is an exaggerated form of manga illustration that squashes the big-eyed characters down for a greater intensity of cuteness. Hart does an excellent job of introducing the concept and of explaining how the drawing technique for this particular style varies from normal manga, and why. Also included are a further exaggerated and simplified form of characters often used for making asides and a section devoted to drawing characters that are varying degrees of feline and human mix. Creative examples are given for all categories, with much potential for sparking the imagination. This volume is a good supplement to more basic manga drawing books that may be in most collections.<i> Dawn Rutherford, King County Library System, Bellevue, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Its sinister black shape exudes Mach3 from every angle. It is the fastest air-breathing airplane the world has ever seen, cruising above 99% of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere at speeds in excess of 2100 mph (3380 km/h) for hour after hour. It is the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. Operated exclusively by the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, 1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron of the US Air Force, Blackbirds glean a wide range of data from &#39;collection areas along the periphery of the Soviet Union and zero in on many other regions of special interest. As recently as April 1986, two SR-71s carried out post-strike reconnaissance of Libyan targets hit by the F-111s of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing. At that time, the SR-71 had been in operational service for a little over 20 years, but instead of its role steadily diminishing, the accident which destroyed the Shuttle Challenger, and the failure of two US Air Force Titan 34D launchers (the payloads were KH-11 and Big Bird spy satellites), the capability and inherent flexibility of the SR-71 remain absolutely critical to the effectiveness of US intelligence gathering. LOCKHEED SR-71 BLACKBIRD is the culmination of patient and diligent research by the author, Paul F. Crickmore. For the first time we have a full account of the Blackbird story, including the contributions made by the A-12 proof-of-concept vehicle and YF-12 interceptor. This 200-page book describes the technological leap in aerodynamics, propulsion, materials, and avionics which stretched the state-of-the-art into a new dimension. Here, too, is the story of the men, the missions, and the records which made the Blackbird a legend. Illustrated with over 160 black-and-white photographs (many previously unpublished), and 12 photographs in full colour, LOCKHEED SR-71 BLACKBIRD contains a glossary, appendices (detailing all the 30-� SR-71s), and an index are also included.</p><p><p><b>Steve Davies</b> is a freelance aviation journalist and photographer living in Cambridge, England.

CABINET</b><p>Inchmale hailed a cab for her, the kind that had always been black, when she'd first known this city.</p><p>Pearlescent silver, this one. Glyphed in Prussian blue, advertising something German, banking services or business software; a smoother simulacrum of its black ancestors, its faux-leather upholstery a shade of orthopedic fawn.</p><p>"Their money's heavy," he said, dropping a loose warm mass of pound coins into her hand. "Buys many whores." The coins still retained the body heat of the fruit machine from which he'd deftly wrung them, almost in passing, on their way out of the King's Something.</p><p>"Whose money?"</p><p>"My countrymen's. Freely given."</p><p>"I don't need this." Trying to hand it back.</p><p>"For the cab." Giving the driver the address in Portman Square.</p><p>"Oh Reg," she said, "it wasn't that bad. I had it in money markets, most of it."</p><p>"Bad as anything else. Call him."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Call him," he repeated, wrapped in Japanese herringbone Gore-Tex, multiply flapped and counter-intuitively buckled.</p><p>He closed the cab's door.</p><p>She watched him through the rear window as the cab pulled away. Stout and bearded, he turned now in Greek Street, a few minutes past midnight, to rejoin his stubborn prot�g�, Clammy of the Bollards. Back to the studio, to take up their lucrative creative struggle.</p><p>She sat back, noticing nothing at all until they passed Selfridges, the driver taking a right.</p><p>The club, only a few years old, was on the north side of Portman Square. Getting out, she paid and generously tipped the driver, anxious to be rid of Inchmale's winnings.</p><p>Cabinet, so called; of Curiosities, unspoken. Inchmale had become a member shortly after they, the three surviving members of the Curfew, had licensed the rights to "Hard to Be One" to a Chinese automobile manufacturer. Having already produced one Bollards album in Los Angeles, and with Clammy wanting to record the next in London, Inchmale had argued that joining Cabinet would ultimately prove cheaper than a hotel. And it had, she supposed, but only if you were talking about a very expensive hotel.</p><p>She was staying there now as a paying guest. Given the state of money markets, whatever those were, and the conversations she'd been having with her accountant in New York, she knew that she should be looking for more modestly priced accommodations.</p><p>A peculiarly narrow place, however expensive, Cabinet occupied half the vertical mass of an eighteenth-century townhouse, one whose fa�ade reminded her of the face of someone starting to fall asleep on the subway. It shared a richly but soberly paneled foyer with whatever occupied the other, westernmost, half of the building, and she'd formed a vague conviction that this must be a foundation of some kind, perhaps philanthropic in nature, or dedicated to the advancement of peace in the Middle East, however eventual. Something hushed, in any case, as it appeared to have no visitors at all.</p><p>There was nothing, on fa�ade or door, to indicate what that might be, no more than there was anything to indicate that Cabinet was Cabinet.</p><p>She'd seen those famously identical, silver-pelted Icelandic twins in the lounge, the first time she'd gone there, both of them drinking red wine from pint glasses, something Inchmale dubbed an Irish affectation. They weren't members, he'd made a point of noting. Cabinet's members, in the performing arts, were somewhat less than stellar, and she assumed that that suited Inchmale just about as well as it suited her.</p><p>It was the decor that had sold Inchmale, he said, and very likely it had been. Both he and it were arguably mad.</p><p>Pushing open the door, through which one might have ridden a horse without having to duck to clear the lintel, she was greeted by Robert, a large and comfortingly chalk-striped young man whose primary task was to mind the entrance without particularly seeming to.</p><p>"Good evening, Miss Henry."</p><p>"Good evening, Robert."</p><p>The decorators had kept it down, here, which was to say that they hadn't really gone publicly, ragingly, batshit insane. There was a huge, ornately carved desk, with something vaguely pornographic going on amid mahogany vines and grape clusters, at which sat one or another of the club's employees, young men for the most part, often wearing tortoiseshell spectacles of the sort she suspected of having been carved from actual turtles.</p><p>Beyond the desk's agreeably archaic mulch of paperwork twined a symmetrically opposed pair of marble stairways, leading to the floor above; that floor being bisected, as was everything above this foyer, into twin realms of presumed philanthropic mystery and Cabinet. From the Cabinet side, now, down the stairs with the wider-shins twist, cascaded the sound of earnest communal drinking, laughter and loud conversation bouncing sharply off unevenly translucent stone, marbled in shades of aged honey, petroleum jelly, and nicotine. The damaged edges of individual steps had been repaired with tidy rectangular inserts of less inspired stuff, pallid and mundane, which she was careful never to step on.</p><p>A tortoise-framed young man, seated at the desk, passed her the room key without being asked.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"You're welcome, Miss Henry."</p><p>Beyond the archway separating the stairways, the floor plan gave evidence of hesitation. Indicating, she guessed, some awkwardness inherent in the halving of the building's original purpose. She pressed a worn but regularly polished brass button, to call down the oldest elevator she'd ever seen, even in London. The size of a small, shallow closet, wider than it was deep, it took its time, descending its elongated cage of black-enameled steel.</p><p>To her right, in shadow, illuminated from within by an Edwardian museum fixture, stood a vitrine displaying taxidermy. Game birds, mostly; a pheasant, several quail, others she couldn't put a name to, all mounted as though caught in motion, crossing a sward of faded billiard-felt. All somewhat the worse for wear, though no more than might be expected for their probable age. Behind them, anthropomorphically upright, forelimbs outstretched in the manner of a cartoon somnambulist, came a moth-eaten ferret. Its teeth, which struck her as unrealistically large, she suspected of being wooden, and painted. Certainly its lips were painted, if not actually rouged, lending it a sinisterly festive air, like someone you'd dread running into at a Christmas party. Inchmale, on first pointing it out to her, had suggested she adopt it as a totem, her spirit beast. He claimed that he already had, subsequently discovering he could magically herniate the disks of unsuspecting music executives at will, causing them to suffer excruciating pain and a profound sense of helplessness.</p><p>The lift arrived. She'd been a guest here long enough to have mastered the intricacies of the articulated steel gate. Resisting an urge to nod to the ferret, she entered and ascended, slowly, to the third floor.</p><p>Here the narrow hallways, walls painted a very dark green, twisted confusingly. The route to her room involved opening several of what she assumed were fire doors, as they were very thick, heavy, and self-closing. The short sections of corridor, between, were hung with small watercolors, landscapes, un-peopled, each one featuring a distant folly. The very <i>same</i> distant folly, she'd noticed, regardless of the scene or region depicted. She refused to give Inchmale the satisfaction he'd derive from her asking about these, so hadn't. Something too thoroughly liminal about them. Best not addressed. Life sufficiently complicated as it was.</p><p>The key, attached to a weighty brass ferrule sprouting thick soft tassels of braided maroon silk, turned smoothly in the lock's brick-sized mass. Admitting her to Number Four, and the concentrated impact of Cabinet's designers' peculiarity, theatrically revealed when she prodded the mother-of-pearl dot set into an otherwise homely gutta-percha button.</p><p>Too tall, somehow, though she imagined that to be the result of a larger room having been divided, however cunningly. The bathroom, she suspected, might actually be larger than the bedroom, if that weren't some illusion.</p><p>They'd run with that tallness, employing a white, custom-printed wallpaper, decorated with ornate cartouches in glossy black. These were comprised, if you looked more closely, of enlarged bits of anatomical drawings of bugs. Scimitar mandibles, spiky elongated limbs, the delicate wings (she imagined) of mayflies. The two largest pieces of furniture in the room were the bed, its massive frame covered entirely in slabs of scrimshawed walrus ivory, with the enormous, staunchly ecclesiastic-looking lower jawbone of a right whale, fastened to the wall at its head, and a birdcage, so large she might have crouched in it herself, suspended from the ceiling. The cage was stacked with books, and fitted, inside, with minimalist Swiss halogen fixtures, each tiny bulb focused on one or another of Number Four's resident artifacts. And not just prop books, Inchmale had proudly pointed out. Fiction or non-, they all seemed to be about England, and so far she'd read parts of Dame Edith Sitwell's <i>English Eccentrics</i> and most of Geoffrey Household's <i>Rogue Male</i>.</p><p>She took off her coat, putting it on a stuffed, satin-covered hanger in the wardrobe, and sat on the edge of the bed to untie her shoes. The Piblokto Madness bed, Inchmale called it. "Intense hysteria," she recited now, from memory, "depression, coprophagia, insensitivity to cold, echolalia." She kicked her shoes in the direction of the wardrobe's open door. "Hold the coprophagia," she added. Cabin fever, this culture-bound, arctic condition. Possibly dietary in origin. Linked to vitamin A toxicity. Inchmale was full of this sort of information, never more so than when he was in the studio. Give Clammy a whole hod of vitamin A, she'd suggested, he looks like he could use it.</p><p>Her gaze fell on three unopened brown cartons, stacked to the left of the wardrobe. These contained shrink-wrapped copies of the British edition of a book she'd written in hotel rooms, though none as peculiarly memorable as this one. She'd begun just after the Chinese car commercial money had come in. She'd gone to Staples, West Hollywood, and bought three flimsy Chinese-made folding tables, to lay the manuscript and its many illustrations out on, in her corner suite at the Marmont. That seemed a long time ago, and she didn't know what she'd do with these copies. The cartons of her copies of the American edition, she now remembered, were still in the luggage room of the Tribeca Grand.</p><p>"Echolalia," she said, and stood, removing her sweater, which she folded and put in a chest-high drawer in the wardrobe, beside a small silk land mine of potpourri. If she didn't touch it, she knew, she wouldn't have to smell it.

He was a land surveyor before leaving for England in 1959 to become a full-time writer. His exploration of the dense forests, rivers and vast savannahs of the Guyanese hinterland features prominently in the settings of his fiction. Harris&#39;s novels are complex, alluding to diverse mythologies from different cultures, and eschew conventional narration in favour of shifting interwoven voices. His first novel Palace of the Peacock (1960) became the first of The Guyana Quartet, which includes The Far Journey of Oudin (1961), The Whole Armour (1962) and The Secret Ladder (1963). He later wrote The Carnival Trilogy (Carnival (1985), The Infinite Rehearsal (1987) and The Four Banks of the River of Space (1990)). His most recent novels are Jonestown (1996), which tells of the mass-suicide of a thousand followers of cult leader Jim Jones; The Dark Jester (2001), his latest semi-autobiographical novel, The Mask of the Beggar (2003), and one of his most accessible novels in decades, The Ghost of Memory (2006). Wilson Harris also writes non-fiction and critical essays and has been awarded honorary doctorates by several universities, including the University of the West Indies (1984) and the University of Liege (2001). He has twice been winner of the Guyana Prize for Literature.</p><h2>The Secret Garden</h2><p><p>When orphaned Mary Lennox, lonely and sad, comes to live at her uncle's great house on the Yorkshire moors, she finds it full of secrets. At night, she hears the sound of crying down one of the long corridors. Outside, she meets Dickon, a magical boy who can charm and talk to animals. Then, one day, with the help of a friendly robin, Mary discovers the most mysterious wonder of all -- a secret garden, walled and locked, which has been completely forgotten for years and years. Is everything in the garden dead, or can Mary bring it back to life?</p></p><p>Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Missalthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>The Illustrated Atlas of the Universe</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Rave Master, Vol. 8</h2><p>With the help of the legendary sword Ten Powers and his guide, the dog Plue, sixteen-year-old Haru Glory sets out to find the five missing RAVE stones and stop the evil Demon Card society from destroying the world.</p><p>A popular animated series directed by Takashi Watanabe (Slayers, Lost Universe) coming soon to Cartoon Network!

She tells her story in <i>Homesick, My Own Story</i>, a Newbery Honor Book. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ms Fritz is the author of forty-five books for children and young people. Many center on historical American figures, gaining her a reputation as the premier author of biographies for children and young people. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among the prestigious awards Ms. Fritz has garnered are: a medal from the National Endowment for the Humanities, a May Hill Arbuthnot Lecture, a Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, an American Book Award, a Christopher Award, a Boston Globe-Horn Book Non-Fiction Award, a<i> New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year, and many ALA Notable Books of the Year, <i>School Library Journal </i>Best Books of the Year, and ALA<i> Booklist</i> Editors&#x2019; Choice Awards.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Fritz ( Shh! We're Writing the Constitution! ) here presents a brisk, highly accessible biography of James Madison. Sickly as a child, Madison was a short, frail man with a wispy, small voice. His successes in incorporating personal freedoms into a reasonably strong centralized government and his enormous appetite for work earned him the sobriquet "great." Madison's shyness and difficulty with public speaking were drawbacks during the politician's early days in Virginia government--as was the enmity of a powerful Patrick Henry--but behind-the-scenes speaking effectiveness and voluminous, well-reasoned writings more than compensated. In her characteristic way of bringing history to life, Fritz writes in a highly engaging, entertaining manner, providing vivid descriptions of Madison's close friendship with Thomas Jefferson; his long and apparently happy marriage to Dolly; the infighting during the creation of the Constitution; the patience with which our fourth president dealt with an unreasonable England, leading to the war of 1812--and that war's defeats and victories.

Yorke (1905-1973) wrote 10 distinguished Symbolist novels in the period from 1926 to 1952. (In February Penguin will reissue six of them, including his major work, Loving , in its Twentieth-Century Classics series.) Green's strength was to cluster seeming trivia in image patterns redolent with meaning; and in Doting and Concluding , he treated sex in uncommonly modern and matter-of-fact terms. For the current volume, Green's grandson has assembled published, unpublished and rejected pieces; synopses and drafts of embryonic work; reviews, and polished jottings. Green's unfinished Mood recalls the world of Virginia Woolf, and there is a review of Woolf's Writer's Diary . In "Excursion" he creates a microcosmic knot of people at a train station, anticipating his novel Party Going. Pieces on the art of fiction include a two-part BBC talk, "A Novelist to His Readers," which reveals the importance Green placed on dialogue. Essays about the fire squad on which Green served in the WW II blitz ("A Rescue," "Before the Great Fire") parallel the topic of his novel Caught. His work for American magazines include "Falling in Love," written for Esquire (he was aggrieved not to be paid for it) and "Invocation to Venice" for Vogue . Among the rejects are a TV drama "Journey Out of Spain" (too long, they said), and "The Jealous Man," turned down by New Yorker editors who promised to keep in mind Green's interest in "books by dead authors." The collection sheds light on the publishing scene in Green's day and adeptly serves the cause of English letters. A memoir by his son closes the volume. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Green, whose real name was Henry Yorke, was a successful businessman and reasonably successful novelist from the 1920s to the 1950s--an author of the type called a "writer's writer." Admired by the likes of Burgess, Welty, and Updike (whose introduction is one of the assets here), Green was sometimes experimental (e.g., he suppressed articles for immediacy of sensation), sometimes lucidly straightforward. Included here are some fables, some rejected short stories, a rather tepid play, a fascinating collaborative interview with Terry Southern (for Paris Review in 1958), and sundry short pieces. Green's novels, of which Loving (1949) is probably the most famous, are about to be reissued by Penguin, but even so mass demand for this title is not likely. Surviving is for true Green enthusiasts or very writerly writers and is therefore appropriate only for very large public and academic libraries.<br><i>- Robert E. Brown, Onondaga Cty.

Anders Eckman, a mild-mannered lab researcher, is sent to investigate. A curt letter reporting his untimely death is all that returns. Now Marina Singh, Anders&#39; colleague and once a student of the mighty Dr Swenson, is their last hope. Compelled by the pleas of Anders&#39;s wife, who refuses to accept that her husband is not coming home, Marina leaves the snowy plains of Minnesota and retraces her friend&#39;s steps into the heart of the South American darkness, determined to track down Dr. Swenson and uncover the secrets being jealously guarded among the remotest tribes of the rainfores</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2011</strong>: In <i>State of Wonder</i>, pharmaceutical researcher Dr. Marina Singh sets off into the Amazon jungle to find the remains and effects of a colleague who recently died under somewhat mysterious circumstances. But first she must locate Dr. Anneck Swenson, a renowned gynecologist who has spent years looking at the reproductive habits of a local tribe where women can conceive well into their middle ages and beyond. Eccentric and notoriously tough, Swenson is paid to find the key to this longstanding childbearing ability by the same company for which Dr. Singh works. Yet that isn&#x2019;t their only connection: both have an overlapping professional past that Dr. Singh has long tried to forget. In finding her former mentor, Dr. Singh must face her own disappointments and regrets, along with the jungle&#x2019;s unforgiving humidity and insects, making <i>State of Wonder</i> a multi-layered atmospheric novel that is hard to put down. Indeed, Patchett solidifies her well-deserved place as one of today&#x2019;s master storytellers. Emotional, vivid, and a work of literature that will surely resonate with readers in the weeks and months to come, <i>State of Wonder</i> truly is a thing of beauty and mystery, much like the Amazon jungle itself. <i>--Jessica Schein</i> <p></p> <br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Elizabeth Gilbert Interviews Ann Patchett </strong> <br> <br> <strong>Elizabeth Gilbert is the author of the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em>, as well as the short story collection <em>Pilgrims</em>&#x2014;a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award, and winner of the 1999 John C.

It was gorgeous and unfamiliar and deeply fascinating. Unfortunately, I stayed there for ten days. There are a lot of insects in the Amazon, a lot of mud, surprisingly few vegetables, too many snakes. You can&#x2019;t go anywhere by yourself, which makes sense if you don&#x2019;t know the terrain, but I enjoy going places by myself. I can see how great it would be for a very short visit, and how great it would be if you lived there and had figured out what was and wasn&#x2019;t going to kill you, but the interim length of time isn&#x2019;t great.</p> <p><strong> EG:</strong> Didn't I hear that you have a sort of magical story about a friend who is also a writer, who was also once going to write a book about the Amazon? Can you share this miraculous tale? Also, is your writer friend pretty?</p> <p><strong> AP:</strong> This friend of mine, who happens to be you, is gorgeous, and much taller in real life. Yes, you were writing a novel about the Amazon, and then you decided not to write a novel about the Amazon, and then I started writing a novel about the Amazon, and later when we compared notes (your book dismissed, mine halfway finished) they had remarkably similar story lines, to the point of being eerie. I thought this must be because it was an incredibly banal idea and we had both come up with a generic Amazon novel, but then you told me that ideas fly around looking for homes, and when the idea hadn&#x2019;t worked out with you it came to me. If this is true I think your name should be on the cover. It would increase sales significantly.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><strong> EG:</strong> Readers of your prior work--particularly the luminous <em>Bel Canto</em>--will be delighted to see that opera makes an appearance in this novel, as well. In fact, one of the most dramatic scenes in the book takes place at the opera. Is that a wink and a nod to loyal readers, or just an expression of your own deep and abiding musical passions?</p> <p><strong> AP:</strong> It&#x2019;s a wink and a nod to Werner Herzog and his brilliant Amazon film &#x201c;Fitzcarraldo&#x201d; which opens at the opera house in Manaus where the aforementioned scene takes place. I had very little experience with opera when I wrote <em>Bel Canto</em>, and since then it&#x2019;s become a huge part of my life. It was fun to write a scene set at the opera now that I know what I&#x2019;m talking about.</p> <p><strong> EG:</strong><em> State of Wonder</em> a rollicking adventure story, full of peril and bravery and death-defying action. I personally know you to be a homebody who likes to bake muffins for neighbors. How the heck did you pull off this wildness so convincingly? Was it as invigorating to write as it is to read?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> Ah, the life of the mind. All the adventure I need I can dream up in my kitchen. I love writing outside of my own experience, making imaginary worlds. If I wrote novels based on my own life I would not be making a living at this. I also love to write a strong plot. I want things to happen in my books, I want to be thrilled. I always think about Raymond Chandler. I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;m getting the phrasing wrong but the general idea is that when things get slow, bring in a man with a gun. If you can&#x2019;t find a gun, a poison arrow works just as well.</p> <p><strong> EG:</strong> The cover is a work of beauty. Authors are not always so lucky. Tell us how you managed such a miracle?</p> <p><strong> AP:</strong> When I first started writing this book, I came downstairs one night and found my husband listening to &#x201c;Horowitz at Carnegie Hall&#x201d;. The album cover has a very lush filigreed border. I had two thoughts: first, I have an amazing husband who thankfully held onto his Horowitz LPs; second, that the album cover had the exact the feeling I wanted for my book--half jungle, half Baroque period. When I was finished writing the novel I sent the album to my editor, who sent it to the art department. They understood exactly what I was talking about.</p><p>Ann Patchett has dazzled readers with her award-winning books, including <em>The Magician's Assistant</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling <em>Bel Canto</em>. Now she raises the bar with <em>State of Wonder</em>, a provocative and ambitious novel set deep in the Amazon jungle. </p><p>Dr. Marina Singh, a research scientist with a Minnesota pharmaceutical company, is sent to Brazil to track down her former mentor, Dr. Annick Swenson, who seems to have all but disappeared in the Amazon while working on what is destined to be an extremely valuable new drug, the development of which has already cost the company a fortune. Nothing about Marina's assignment is easy: not only does no one know where Dr. Swenson is, but the last person who was sent to find her, Marina's research partner Anders Eckman, died before he could complete his mission. Plagued by trepidation, Marina embarks on an odyssey into the insect-infested jungle in hopes of finding her former mentor as well as answers to several troubling questions about her friend's death, the state of her company's future, and her own past. </p><p>Once found, Dr. Swenson, now in her seventies, is as ruthless and uncompromising as she ever was back in the days of Grand Rounds at Johns Hopkins. With a combination of science and subterfuge, she dominates her research team and the natives she is studying with the force of an imperial ruler. But while she is as threatening as anything the jungle has to offer, the greatest sacrifices to be made are the ones Dr. Swenson asks of herself, and will ultimately ask of Marina, who finds she may still be unable to live up to her teacher's expectations. </p><p>In a narrative replete with poison arrows, devouring snakes, and a neighboring tribe of cannibals, <em>State of Wonder</em> is a world unto itself, where unlikely beauty stands beside unimaginable loss. It is a tale that leads the reader into the very heart of darkness, and then shows us what lies on the other side. </p></p><h2>The Intrinsic Energies of T&#39;Ai Chi Ch&#39;Uan (Chen Kung Series, Vol 2)</h2><p>A fresh translation of a T&#39;ai Chi classic is always a major event in the martial arts community.

Some of the stories are linked and some carry O'Brien's distinct sense of the comical. In "A Rose in the Heart of New York," the single-mindedness of love dramatically derails the relationship between a girl and her mother, while in "Sister Imelda" and "The Creature" the strong ties between teacher and student and mother and son are ultimately broken. "The Love Object" recounts a passionate affair between the narrator and her older lover.<br><br>The magnificent, mid-career title story from <em>Lantern Slides</em> portrays a Dublin dinner party that takes on the lives and loves of all the guests. More recent stories include "Shovel Kings"--"a masterpiece of compression, distilling the pain of a lost, exiled generation" (<em>Sunday Times</em>)--and "Old Wounds," which follows the revival and demise of the friendship between two elderly cousins.<br><br>In 2011, Edna O'Brien's gifts were acknowledged with the most prestigious international award for the story, the Frank O'Connor Short Story Award. THE LOVE OBJECT illustrates a career's worth of shimmering, potent prose from a writer of great courage, vision, and heart.<br><br>"The most striking aspect of Edna O'Brien's short stories, aside from the consistent mastery with which they are executed, is their diversity."--<strong>John Banville</strong></p><p><b>Edna O'Brien</b> is the author of <em>The Country Girls Trilogy</em>, <em>The Light of Evening</em>, <em>Saints and Sinners</em>, <em>Country Girl</em>, and other widely acclaimed books. Born and raised in the west of Ireland, she has lived in London for many years."When a writer as gifted as O'Brien memorializes a vanishing world, we experience not only the 'lost landscape' but the richly ambivalent emotions it has evoked."&#x2015;<b><i>Joyce Carol Oates, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br><i></i></i></b><br><br>"Every one of the stories included is a shining example of a master at work."&#x2015;<b><i>Lucy Scholes, <i>Observer</i></i></b><br><br>As well as being an intensely enjoyable book, it is a very important publication in the history of Irish literature: the selected stories of one of the major writers of our era."&#x2015;<b><i>Eilis Ni Dhuibhne, <i>Irish Times</i></i></b><br><br>"A career's selection of stories to savor.... Hers is not the sort of writing that indulges in what one story dismisses as 'clever words and hollow feelings'; her stories ask impossibly difficult questions about the nature of love and the possibility of happiness, and they refuse to settle for easy answers.... This collection positions O'Brien among the literary heavyweights, where it confirms she belongs."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Kirkus Reviews </em>(starred review)</i></b><br><br>"O'Brien is an Irish natural treasure, having secured a place in the pantheon of top-notch twentieth-century Irish writers of fiction....

Includes six envelopes containing letters and cards. Illustrated in colour.</p><p>Janet Ahlberg, along with Allan Ahlberg, created some of the world&#39;s most popular picture books, including EACH PEACH PEAR PLUM and THE JOLLY CHRISTMAS POSTMAN, both winners of Greenaway Medals, and THE BABY&#39;S CATALOGUE, inspired by their daughter Jessica. Janet died in 1994.This British import is great fun, sure to entertain children and parents alike. The Jolly Postman goes from home to home in a fairy-tale kingdom, delivering letters to such familiar addresses as "Mr. and Mrs. Bear, Three Bears Cottage, The Woods." Every other page is an actual envelope, with a letter tucked inside. The letter to the three bears, for instance, is from Goldilocks, who apologizes for the trouble she's caused and invites Baby Bear to her birthday party. Some authors would stop with this cute concept, but the Ahlbergs have given this book their all. The story of the postman's travels is told in charming verse; the pictures are delightful, full of clever detail; and the results are frequently hilarious. (The wicked witch of "Hansel and Gretel" fame, for instance, receives a circular from Hobgoblin Supplies Ltd. which advertises such appealing products as Little Boy Pie Mix.) A real treat at a good price. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mr Campion&#39;s Fox (An Albert Campion Mystery, 2)</h2><p><b><i>This brand-new novel featuring Margery Allingham&#x2019;s Mr Campion recaptures the Golden Age of British Detective Fiction.</i></b><br><br>The Danish Ambassador has requested Albert Campion&#x2019;s help on &#x2018;a delicate family matter&#x2019;.

Cowman, L. B. Cowman, L B Cowman</p><p></p><h2>A Day&#39;s Work</h2><p>Francisco, a young Mexican-American boy, tries to help his grandfather, recently arrived from Mexico and unable to speak English, find work as a gardener and, in the process, discovers the importance of honesty.</p><p>No BioFrancisco, trying to find work for his grandfather, or abuelo, who has just arrived from Mexico, acts as a liaison between Abuelo, who doesn't speak English, and Ben, who wants to hire a gardener for a day's work. Eager to earn the badly needed pay, Francisco assures Ben that his grandfather is a skilled gardener (Abuelo is in fact a carpenter). Returning at the end of the day, Ben is shocked to discover that Francisco and Abuelo stripped his field of the plants and left the weeds. Abuelo is also angered, learning only now that Francisco had lied to Ben, and refuses payment until they have done the job correctly. Recognizing the older man's integrity, Ben rewards Abuelo and Francisco with the promise of "more than just one day's work." Says Ben of the plants: "The roots are still there. If they've replanted early, they'll be alright." Similarly, Francisco is given a chance to start over. He changes from a naively parental figure to a child who "had begun to learn the important things." The shift in the boy's role quietly suggests not only the importance of a work ethic but also Francisco's need to be a child, guided by a caring adult. With expressive, gestural watercolors, Himler, who illustrated Bunting's Fly Away Home and Someday a Tree, conveys the boy's complex relationship with his grandfather and strongly invokes both the harsh and the tender landscapes of Francisco's world.

A chronicle of the author's search for a civilization "reduced to its most basic expression."</p><p>"I hate travelling and explorers," famously declared Claude L�vi-Strauss, but how fortunate for readers that he should overcome his loathing to write about his experiences among the indigenous peoples of the Brazilian interior, including the Caduveo, Bororo, and Nambikwara tribes. Those who know L�vi-Strauss and <i>Tristes Tropiques</i> by reputation only will be pleasantly surprised by the intimate tone that colors even its most precise anthropological sections, as well as the autobiographical passages at the beginning, in which the author recounts how he fell into his career and how, shortly after the Nazis occupied Paris, he was forced to flee to America in a grueling sea voyage. Twenty-five black-and-white photographs of tribespeople, as well as numerous line drawings, accompany the text.Tristes Tropiques is one of the great books of our century," said Susan Sontag. "It is rigorous, subtle, and bold in thought. It is beauti-<br>fully written. And, like all great books, it bears an absolutely personal stamp; it speaks with a human voice."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tristes Tropiques was an immensely popular bestseller when it was first published in <br>France in 1955. Claude L�vi-Strauss's ground-<br>breaking study of the societies of a number of Amazonian peoples is a cornerstone of structural anthropology and an exploration by the author of his own intellectual roots as a professor of philosophy in Brazil before the Second World War, as a Jewish exile from Nazi-occupied Europe, and later as a world-renowned academic (he taught at New York's New School for Social Research and was French cultural attach� to the United States). L�vi-Strauss's central journey leads from the Amazon basin through the dense upland jungles of Brazil. There, among the Amerindian tribes--the Caduveo, Bororo, Nambikwara, and Tupi-Kawahib--he found "a human society reduced to its most basic expression." L�vi-Strauss's discussion of his fieldwork in Tristes Tropiques endures as a milestone of anthropology, but the book is also, in its brilliant diversions on other, more familiar cultures, a great work of literature, a vivid travelogue, and an engaging memoir--a demonstration of the marvelous mental agility of one of the century<br>'s most important thinkers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presented here is the translation by John and Doreen Weightman of the complete text of the revised French edition of 1968, together with the original photographs and illustrations. <br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurat-<br>ing a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><h2>And It Was Good: Reflections on Beginnings (Wheaton Literary Series)</h2><p><p>This classic work of spirituality from the author of <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> offers life-transforming insights on the rich heritage of the Bible and shows how the characters of this ancient text are relevant for living the good life now.</p><p>In the first book of her Genesis Trilogy, beloved author Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle casts long, loving, and perceptive glances not only at the created universe but also at its Creator. L&#x2019;Engle often crafted stories that dealt with the complexities of the universe, navigating time and space, religion and science, with uncanny ease and insight. This skill&#x2014;most famously demonstrated in <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>&#x2014;is showcased in this nonfiction work, <i>And It Was Good</i>, through her ability to see the connection between Made and Maker at every level. She examines the vast beauty, order, and complexity of our world with enthusiasm and reverence, illuminating the characteristics of God, the first poet.</p><p>Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle possesses the same ambidextrous skill of storytelling as other literary giants, including C.S. Lewis and George MacDonald. Her fictional stories appeal to generations of readers, and are equally embraced in both the secular and religious markets. But it is her ability in her nonfiction to engage with the historical text of the Bible through a dynamic unpacking of protagonists, antagonists, and matters of faith that establishes The Genesis Trilogy as a highly treasured collection of spiritual writings. <i>And It Was Good</i> beautifully approaches both the biblical text and creation itself with an intelligence and sensitivity that appeals to all seekers looking for a fresh communion with God in the natural world.</p></p><p>Madeleine L'Engle is the author of more than forty-five books for all ages, among them the beloved <i>A Wrinkle in Time,</i> awarded the Newbery Medal; <i>A Ring of Endless Light,</i> a Newbery Honor Book; <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet,</i> winner of the American Book Award; and the Austin family series of which <i>Troubling a Star</i> is the fifth book. L'Engle was named the 1998 recipient of the Margaret A. Edwards award, honoring her lifetime contribution in writing for teens.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle was born in 1918 in New York City, late in her parents' lives,an only child growing up in an adult world. Her father was a journalist who had been a foreign correspondent, and although he suffered from mustard gas poisoning in World War I, his work still took him abroad a great deal. Her mother was a musician; the house was filled with her parents' friends: artists, writers, and musicians. "Their lives were very full and they didn't really have time for a child," she says. "So I turned to writing to amuse myself."<br><br>When she was 12, Ms. L'Engle moved with her family to the French Alps in search of purer air for her father's lungs. She was sent to an English boarding school --"dreadful," she says. When she was 14, her family returned to America and she went to boarding school once again, Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina--which she loved. When she was 17, her father died.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle spent the next four years at Smith College. After graduating cum laude, she and an assortment of friends moved to an apartment in Greenwich Village. "I still wanted to be a writer; I always wanted to be a writer, but I had to pay the bills, so I went to work in the theater," she says.<br><br>Touring as an actress seems to have been a catalyst for her. She wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain,</i> while touring with Eva Le Gallienne in <i>Uncle Harry</i>. She met Hugh Franklin, to whom she was married until his death in 1986, while they were rehearsing <i>The Cherry Orchard,</i> and they were married on tour during a run of <i>The Joyous Season,</i> starring Ethel Barrymore.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle retired from the stage after her marriage, and the Franklins moved to northwest Connecticut and opened a general store. "The surrounding area was real dairy farmland then, and very rural. Some of the children had never seen books when they began their first year of school," she remembers. The Franklins raised three children--Josephine, Maria, and Bion. Ms. L'Engle's first book in the Austin quintet, <i>Meet the Austins,</i> an ALA Notable Children's Book, has strong parallels with her life in the country. But she says, "I identify with Vicky rather than with Mrs. Austin, since I share all of Vicky's insecurities, enthusiasms, and times of sadness and growth."<br><br>When, after a decade in Connecticut, the family returned to New York, Ms. L'Engle rejoiced. "In some ways, I was back in the real world." Mr. Franklin resumed acting, and became well known as Dr. Charles Tyler in the television series <i>All My Children.</i> <i>Two-Part Invention</i> is Ms. L'Engle's touching and critically acclaimed story of their long and loving marriage. <br><br>The Time quintet--<i>A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters,</i> and <i>An Acceptable Time</i>--are among her most famous books, but it took years to get a publisher to accept <i>A Wrinkle in Time.</i> "Every major publisher turned it down. No one knew what to do with it," she says. When Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux finally accepted the manuscript, she insisted that they publish it as a children's book. It was the beginning of their children's list."<br><br>Today, Ms. L'Engle lives in New York City and Connecticut, writing at home and at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, where she is variously the librarian and the writer-in-residence. "It depends from day-to-day on what they want to call me. I do keep the library collection--largely theology, philosophy, a lot of good reference books--open on a volunteer basis."<br><b>Author Fun Facts<br><br></b><i>Born<br></i>November 29 in New York City<br><br><i>Education<br></i>Smith College, The New School, Columbia University<br><br><i>Currently lives<br></i>New York City and Connecticut<br><br><i>Fun Jobs<br></i>Librarian, actress<br><br><i>Favorite...<br></i>...hobbies: traveling, reading, playing the piano, and cooking<br><b>A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle<br><br>"</b>I wrote my first story when I was 5. It was about a little G-R-U-L, because that&#x2019;s how I spelled &#x201c;girl&#x201d; when I was 5. I wrote because I wanted to know what everything was about. My father, before I was born, had been gassed in the first World War, and I wanted to know why there wer wars, why people hurt each other, why we couldn&#x2019;t get along together, and what made people tick. That&#x2019;s why I started to write stories.<br><br>The books I read most as a child were by Lucy Maud Montgomery, who&#x2019;s best known for her Anne of Green Gables stories, but I also liked Emily of New Moon. Emily was an only child, as I was. Emily lived on an island, as did I. Although Manhattan Island and Prince Edward Island are not very much alike, they are still islands. Emily&#x2019;s father was dying of bad lungs, and so was mine. Emily had some dreadful relative, and so did I. She had a hard time in school, and she also understood that there&#x2019;s more to life than just the things that can be explained by encyclopedias and facts. Facts alone are not adequate. I love Emily. I also read E. Nesbit, who was a nineteenth-century writer of fantasies and family stories, and I read fairy tales and the myths of all countries. And anything I could get my hands on.<br><br>As an adult, I like to read fiction. I really enjoy good murder mystery writers, usually women, frequently English, because they have a sense of what the human soul is about and why people do dark and terrible things. I also read quite a lot in the area of particle physics and quantum mechanics, because this is theology. This is about the nature of being. This is what life is all about. I try to read as widely as I possibly can.<br><br>I wrote <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> when we were living in a small dairy farm village in New England. I had three small children to raise, and life was not easy. We lost four of our closest friends within two years by death--that&#x2019;s a lot of death statistically. And I really wasn&#x2019;t finding the answers to my big questions in the logical places. So, at the time I discovered the world of particle physics. I discovered Einstein and relativity. I read a book of Einstein&#x2019;s, in which he said that anyone who&#x2019;s not lost in rapturous awe at the power and glory of the mind behind the universe is as good as a burnt-out candle. And I thought, &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve found my theologian, what a wonderful thing.&#x201d; I began to read more in that area. <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> came out of these questions, and out of my discovery of the post-utopian sciences, which knocked everything we knew about science for a loop.<br><br><i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was almost never published. You can&#x2019;t name a major publisher who didn&#x2019;t reject it. And there were many reasons. One was that it was supposedly too hard for children. Well, my children were 7, 10, and 12 while I was writing it. I&#x2019;d read to them at night what I&#x2019;d written during the day, and they&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Ooh, mother, go back to the typewriter!&#x201d; <i>A Wrinkle in Time&#x201d; </i>had a female protagonist in a science fiction book, and that wasn&#x2019;t done. And it dealt with evil and things that you don&#x2019;t find, or didn&#x2019;t at that time, in children&#x2019;s books. When we&#x2019;d run through forty-odd publishers, my agent sent it back. We gave up. Then my mother was visiting for Christmas, and I gave her a tea party for some of her old friends. One of them happened to belong to a small writing group run by John Farrar, of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, which at that time did not have a juvenile list. She insisted that I meet John any how, and I went down with my battered manuscript. John had read my first novel and liked it, and read this book and loved it. That&#x2019;s how it happened.<br><br>The most asked question that I generally receive is, &#x201c;Where do you get your ideas?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s very easily answered. I tell a story about Johann Sebastian Bach when he was an old man. A student asked him, &#x201c;Papa Bach, where do you get the ideas for all of these melodies?&#x201d; And the old man said, &#x201c;Why, when I get up in the morning, it&#x2019;s all I can do not to trip over them.&#x201d; And that&#x2019;s how ideas are; they&#x2019;re just everywhere. I think the least asked question is one that I got in Japan. This little girl held up her hand and said, &#x201c;How tall are you?&#x201d; In Japan, I am very tall.<br><br>I get over one hundred letters a week. There are always letters that stand out. There was one from a 12-year-old girl in North Carolina who wrote me many years ago, saying &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jewish and most of my friends are Christian. My Christian friends told me only Christians can be saved. What do you think? Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d; Well, we corresponded for about twenty years. I suggested that she go back to read some of the great Jewish writers to find out about her own tradition. Another letter asked, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re studying the crusades in school. Can there be such a thing as a Holy War? Is war ever right?&#x201d; I mean, kids don&#x2019;t hesitate to ask questions. And it&#x2019;s a great honor to have the kids say, &#x201c;Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d;<br><br>The questions are not always about the books. They&#x2019;re sometimes about the deepest issues of life. &#x201c;Why did my parents put my grandmother in a nursing home?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s one that has come up several times. The letters are enlightening, particularly when t...</p><h2>Journey to Japan (UNICEF Book)</h2><p>Describes the daily life, customs, legends, and festivals in Japan.

J. Rushdoony eBook $6.99 Register to Purchase Paperback $16.00 Register to Purchase Description Additional Information Look Inside The Christian School represents a break with humanistic education, but, too often, in leaving the state school, the Christian educator has carried the state s humanism with him. A curriculum is not neutral: it is either a course in humanism or training in a God-centered faith and life. The liberal arts curriculum means literally that course which trains students in the arts of freedom. This raises the key question: is freedom in and of man or Christ? The Christian art of freedom, that is, the Christian liberal arts curriculum, is emphatically not the same as the humanistic one. It is urgently necessary for Christian educators to rethink the meaning and nature of the curriculum. In this study Rousas John Rushdoony develops the philosophy of the Christian curriculum. It is the pioneering study in this field, and it is important reading for all Christian educators.</p><p></p><h2>So Many Dynamos!: and Other Palindromes</h2><p>From the creator of <i>Go Hang A Salami! I'm a Lasagna Hog! </i>comes another collection of reversable phrases.<br>Jon Agee and his better half, Eega Noj, have conspired again to inspire palindromania in Mom, Pop, Sis, and the family pup. With over sixty new reversible absurdities, readers will be doing a double take, while the preposterous illustrations leave them begging between guffaws, No, Jon!<br></p><p>Palindromic pundit Agee follows up his Go Hang a Salami! I'm a Lasagna Hog! with another volume of black-and-white cartoons and punchy captions that can be read forward or backward. Some of the palindromes clearly will tickle kids' fancy: "Pupil's slipup" shows a child drawing a caricature of his teacher, unaware that the subject of his ridicule is peering over his shoulder; and a girl sipping through a straw looks aghast at hairy bumps on it ("Straw warts"). Other Agee creations seemed aimed at adults: in "Diana Bruno, On Urban Aid," a woman points at a labyrinthine diagram of where tax dollars are going; and "Flo, Gin is a sin! I golf!" says one golf-club-toting nun to a sister grabbing a drink at a bar. Two other palindromes also involve bar scenes, which may offend some parents, librarians or teachers. Also running to the off-color (but likely to please kids) are such cartoons as that of a dog lifting his leg as he addresses a man painting the Tower of Pisa ("As I pee, sir, I see Pisa!"); and that of a scientist gazing through an enormous microscope as a colleague wonders what he sees: "Snot or protons?" All ages. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 3-6. Like Agee's earlier collection of palindromes (words or phrases that read the same, backwards or forwards) <i>Go Hang a Salami! I'm a Lasagna Hog</i> (1992), this book features one palindromic phrase per page or spread. Cartoonlike drawings with gray washes give the sometimes oddly matched words such as "Gabe's on a Nosebag" and "Snot or Protons" a context, giving readers a reason to chuckle at an otherwise irrational phrase. The book will certainly please children (and adults) who love wordplay; they'll marvel at Agee's inventiveness. Even children who have never heard of a palindrome will be drawn to the cartoons, while readers fascinated by concept may want to try writing (and illustrating) their own. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Books: World War II</h2><p>Some of the most popular selections from the formidable Eyewitness backlist are now available with a clip-art CD included-with no increase in price!<br><br><b>Book Details:</b><ul><li>Format: Hardcover</li><li>Publication Date: 6/25/2007</li><li>Pages: 72</li><li>Reading Level: Age 8 and Up</li></ul></p><p>Take an eyewitness view of the complexities, atrocities, and heroics of war with <i>World War II</i>, from DK's Eyewitness series.

That was the essence of early Christianity. It was not a Christianity of words, but rather of holy, obedient living. <br><br> This book contains two second-century Christian works, translated into readable contemporary English: Mark Felix s Octavius and Justin Martyr s First Apology. They describe the dynamic living church of the second century and discuss what Christians of that age believed. <br><br> The First Apology of Justin Martyr is the oldest Christian apology still in existence. Justin penned this work at the risk of his own life. Apart from the inspired New Testament writings, this apology is perhaps the single most valuable work of early Christianity. Through it, we can take a peek through time to see what Christianity was like at the close of the apostolic age. For example, Justin takes us on a tour of a Christian baptism and a typical Sunday morning church service. He lets us know what Christians in his age believed about Jesus, salvation, predestination, communion, and life after death. <br><br> Octavius, written by a Christian lawyer named Mark Felix, takes a look at Christianity from both the pagan and Christian viewpoints. It s not only one of the most readable early Christian works, but it s also a true work of literature. Felix writes in a graceful Latin style that rivals that of Cicero, and his defense of Christianity is truly inspiring. In the end, Octavius is more than a challenge to the pagan Romans it s a challenge to the twentieth century church as well.</p><p>Justin Martyr was a philosopher who converted to Christianity and became a tireless evangelist. His works are the earliest Christian apologies still in existence in their entirety. He was executed during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, about A.D. 165. <p>Mark Felix was a Roman lawyer who converted to Christianity. His Octavius is often considered the finest apology written by any primitive Christian.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek, Latin</p><h2>The McDuff Stories</h2><p>A gift edition features the plucky West Highland terrier and brings together four adventures including McDuff Moves In, McDuff Comes Home, McDuff and the Baby, and McDuff&#39;s New Friend.</p><p></p><h2>Saint Joseph of Copertino</h2><p>An incredible Franciscan saint (1603-1663), most famous for his miracles, levitations and severe penances.

No Fair!</i>A Stranger with a Camera<br><br>Jeremiah, Kentucky<br><br>APRIL 1969<br><br>On a bright afternoon in September, in 1967, a five-�man film crew working in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky stopped to take pictures of some people near a place called Jeremiah. In a narrow valley, a half-�dozen dilapidated shacks&#x2014;�each one a tiny square box with one corner cut away to provide a cluttered front porch&#x2014;�stood alongside the county blacktop. Across the road from the shacks, a mountain rose abruptly. In the field that separated them from the mountain behind them, there were a couple of ramshackle privies and some clotheslines tied to trees and a railroad track and a rusted automobile body and a dirty river called Rockhouse Creek. The leader of the film crew was a Canadian named Hugh O&#x2019;Connor. Widely acclaimed as the co-�producer of the Labyrinth show at Expo 67 in Montreal, O&#x2019;Connor had been hired by Francis Thompson, an American filmmaker, to work on a film Thompson was producing for the American pavilion at HemisFair in San Antonio. O&#x2019;Connor went up to three of the shacks and asked the head of each household for permission to take pictures. When each one agreed, O&#x2019;Connor had him sign the customary release forms and gave him a token payment of ten dollars&#x2014;�a token that, in this case, happened to represent a month&#x2019;s rent. The light was perfect in the valley, and the shooting went well. Theodore Holcomb, the associate producer of the film, was particularly struck by the looks of a miner, still in his work clothes and still covered with coal dust, sitting in a rocking chair on one of the porches. &#x201c;He was just sitting there scratching his arm in a listless way,&#x201d; Holcomb said later. &#x201c;He had an expression of total despair. It was an extraordinary shot&#x2014;�so evocative of the despair of that region.&#x201d;<br><br>The shot of the coal miner was good enough to be included in the final version of the film, and so was a shot of a half-�dozen children who, somehow, lived with their parents in one of the tiny shacks. After about an hour and a half, the crew was ready to leave, but someone had noticed a woman come out of one of the shacks and go to the common well to draw some water, and she was asked to repeat the action for filming. As that last shot was being completed, a woman drove up and told the filmmakers that the man who owned the property was coming to throw them off of it. Then she drove away. A couple of minutes later, another car arrived, and a man&#x2014;�a thin, bald man&#x2014;�leaped out. He was holding a pistol. &#x201c;Get off my property!&#x201d; he shouted again and again. Then he shot twice. No one was hit. The filmmakers kept moving their equipment �toward their cars across the road while trying to tell the man that they were leaving. One of them said that the man must be shooting blanks. &#x201c;Get off my property!&#x201d; he kept screaming. Hugh O&#x2019;Connor, who was lugging a heavy battery across the highway, turned to say that they were going. The man held the pistol in both hands and pulled the trigger again. &#x201c;Mr. O&#x2019;Connor briefly looked down in amazement, and I saw a hole in his chest,&#x201d; Holcomb later testified in court. &#x201c;He saw it and he looked up in despair and said, &#x2018;Why did you have to do that?&#x2019; and, with blood coming from his mouth, he fell to the ground.&#x201d;<br><br>Whitesburg, a town about twelve miles from Jeremiah, is the county seat of Letcher County&#x2014;�headquarters for the county court, the sheriff, and assorted coal companies and antipoverty agencies. Word that someone had been killed reached Whitesburg quickly, but for a couple of hours there was some confusion about just who the victim was. According to various stories, the dead man had been a representative of the Army Corps of Engineers, a VISTA volunteer, or a CBS cameraman&#x2014;�any of whom might qualify as a candidate for shooting in Letcher County. The Corps of Engineers had proposed building the Kingdom Come Dam across Rockhouse Creek, thereby flooding an area that included Jeremiah, and some opponents of the dam had been saying that the first government man who came near their property had better come armed. Throughout Eastern Kentucky, local political organizations and coal-�mining interests had warned that community organizers who called themselves Vistas or Appalachian Volunteers or anything else were nothing but another variety of Communists&#x2014;�three of them had been arrested on charges of attempting to overthrow the government of Pike County&#x2014;�and even some of the impoverished people whom the volunteers were supposedly in Kentucky to help viewed them with fear and suspicion. A number of television crews had been to Letcher County to record the despair that Holcomb saw in the face of the miner sitting on the front porch. Whitesburg happens to be the home of Harry M. Caudill, a lawyer who drew attention to the plight of the mountain people in 1963 with an eloquent book called Night Comes to the Cumberlands. Television crews and reporters on a tour of Appalachia are tempted to start with Letcher County in order to get the benefit of Caudill&#x2019;s counsel, which is ordinarily expressed in a tone of sustained rage&#x2014;�rage at the profit ratio of out-�of-�state companies that take the region&#x2019;s natural resources while paying virtually no taxes, rage at the strip mines that are gouged across the mountains and at the mudslides and floods and pollution and ugliness they cause, rage at the local merchants and politicians who make a good living from the trade of welfare recipients or the retainers of coal companies and insist that there is nothing wrong with the economy, and, most of all, rage at the country that could permit it all to happen. &#x201c;Look what man hath wrought on that purple mountain&#x2019;s majesty,&#x201d; he will say as he points out the coal waste on the side of a mountain that had once been beautiful. &#x201c;A country that treats its land and people this way deserves to perish from the earth.&#x201d;<br><br>In the view of Caudill and of Tom Gish, the liberal editor of The Mountain Eagle, a Letcher County weekly, the reactions of people in Jeremiah to the presence of O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s film crew&#x2014;�cooperation by the poor people being photographed in their squalid shacks, rage by the man who owned the shacks&#x2014;�were characteristic of Letcher County: a lot of people who are still in Eastern Kentucky after years of welfare or subsistence employment have lost the will to treat their situation as an embarrassment, but outside journalists are particularly resented by the people who have managed to make a living&#x2014;�running a country store or a filling station or a small truck mine, working for the county administration, managing some rental property. They resent the impression that everyone in Eastern Kentucky is like the people who are desperately poor&#x2014;�people whose condition they tend to blame on &#x201c;just sorriness, mostly.&#x201d; In Letcher County, fear of outsiders by people who are guarding reputations or economic interests blends easily into a deep-�rooted suspicion of outsiders by all Eastern Kentucky mountain people, who have always had a fierce instinct to protect their property and a distrust of strangers that has often proved to have been justified. All of the people in Letcher County&#x2014;�people who live in the shacks up remote hollows or people who run stores on Main Street in Whitesburg&#x2014;�consider themselves mountain people, and, despite an accurate story in The Mountain Eagle, many of them instinctively believed that the mountaineer who killed Hugh O&#x2019;Connor was protecting his property from smart-�aleck outsiders who wouldn&#x2019;t leave when they were told.<br><br>The mountaineer&#x2019;s name was Hobart Ison. There have always been Isons in Letcher County, and many of them have managed somewhat better than their neighbors. Hobart Ison had inherited a rather large piece of land in Jeremiah&#x2014;�he raised chickens and rented out shacks he himself had built and at one time ran a small sawmill&#x2014;�but he was known mainly as an eccentric, mean-�tempered old man. Everyone in Letcher County knew that Hobart Ison had once built and furnished a house for his future bride and&#x2014;�having been rejected or having been afraid to ask or having had no particular future bride in mind&#x2014;�had let the house remain as it was for thirty years, the grass growing up around it and the furniture still in the packing crates. He had occasionally painted large signs attacking the people he thought had wronged him. He was easily enraged by people hunting on his property, and he despised all of the local Democrats, whom he blamed for injustices that included dismissing him from a post-�office job. A psychiatrist who examined him after the shooting said, &#x201c;Any reference to &#x2018;game warden&#x2019; or &#x2018;Democrat&#x2019; will provoke him tremendously.&#x201d; Once, when some local youths were taunting him, he took a shot at them, hitting one in the shoulder. &#x201c;A lot of people around here would have welcomed them,&#x201d; Caudill said of the filmmakers. &#x201c;They just happened to pick the wrong place.&#x201d;<br><br>Streams of people came to visit Ison in the Letcher County jail before he was released on bail. Women from around Jeremiah baked him cakes. When his trial came up, it proved impossible to find a jury. The Letcher County commonwealth&#x2019;s attorney and Caudill, who had been retained by Francis Thompson, Inc., secured a change of venue. They argued that Ison&#x2019;s family relationship in Letcher County was &#x201c;so extensive as to comprise a large segment of the population,&#x201d; and, through an affidavit signed by three citizens in a position to know public opinion, they stated that &#x201c;the overwhelming expression of sentiment has been to the effect that the defendant did right in the slaying of Hugh O&#x2019;Connor and that he ought to be acquitted of the offense of murder.&#x201d;<br><br>Harlan County is a mountain or two away from Letcher County. In the town of Harlan, benches advertising Bunny enriched bread stand outside the front door of the county courthouse, flanking the First World War monument and the Revolutionary War monument and the plaque recalling how many Kentucky courthouses were burned down by each side during the Civil War. On the ground floor of the courthouse, the men who habitually gather on the plain wooden benches to pass the time use old No. 5 cans for ashtrays or spittoons and a large container that once held Oscar Mayer pure lard as a wastebasket. In the courtroom, a plain room with all of its furnishings painted black, the only decoration other than pictures of the men who have served as circuit judge is a framed poster in praise of the country lawyer&#x2014;�and also in praise, it turns out upon close reading, of the Dun &amp; Bradstreet corporation. The front door of the courthouse is almost always plastered with election stickers. In the vestibule just inside, an old man sits on the floor behind a display of old pocketknives and watchbands and billfolds and eyeglass cases offered for sale or trade.<br><br>The commonwealth&#x2019;s attorney of Harlan County is Daniel Boone Smith. Eight or nine years ago, Smith got curious about how many people he had prosecuted or defended for murder, and counted up seven hundred and fifty. He was able to amass that total partly because of longevity (except for a few years in the service during the Second World War, he has been commonwealth&#x2019;s attorney continuously since 1933), partly because he has worked in an area that gives anyone interested in trying murder cases plenty of opportunity (the wars between the unions and the coal operators in Harlan County during the thirties were almost as bloody as the mountain feuds earlier in the century), and partly because he happens to be a quick worker (&#x201c;Some people will take three days to try a murder case,&#x201d; he has said. &#x201c;I usually get my case on in a day&#x201d;). During his first week as commonwealth&#x2019;s attorney of Harlan and an adjoining county, Smith tried five murder cases. These days, Harlan County may have about that many a year, but it remains a violent place. The murders that do occur in mountain counties like Harlan and Letcher often seem to occur while someone is in a drunken rage, and often among members of the same family&#x2014;�a father shooting a son over something trivial, one member of a family mowing down another who is breaking down the door trying to get at a third. &#x201c;We got people in this county today who would kill you as quick as look at you,&#x201d; Smith has said. &#x201c;But most of &#x2019;em are the type that don&#x2019;t bother you if you leave them alone.&#x201d; Smith is known throughout Eastern Kentucky for his ability to select jurors&#x2014;�to remember which prospective juror&#x2019;s uncle may have had a boundary dispute with which witness&#x2019;s grandfather twenty years ago&#x2014;�and for his ability to sum up the case for them in their own language once the evidence has been heard. He is an informal, colloquial, storytelling man who happens to be a graduate of Harvard Law School.<br><br>A lack of fervor about convicting Hobart Ison was assumed in Harlan County when he came up for trial there in May 1968. &#x201c;Before the case, people were coming up and saying, &#x2018;He should&#x2019;ve killed the son of a bitch,&#x2019; &#x201d; Smith said later. &#x201c;People would say, &#x2018;They oughtn&#x2019;t to make fun of mountain people. They&#x2019;ve made enough fun of mountain people. Let me on the jury, Boone, and I&#x2019;ll turn him loose.&#x2019; &#x201d; Smith saw his task as persuading the citizens and the jurors that the case was not what it appeared to be&#x2014;�that the filmmakers were not &#x201c;a bunch of privateers and pirates&#x201d; but respectable people who had been commissioned by the United States government, that the film was not another study of how poor and ignorant people were in Eastern Kentucky but a film about the whole United States in which the shots of Eastern Kentucky would take up only a few seconds, that the filmmakers had behaved properly and politely to those they were photographing. &#x201c;Why, if they had been smart alecks come to hold us up to ridicule, I&#x2019;d be the last man to try him,&#x201d; Smith assured everyone. It took Smith only a day or so to present his case against Hobart Ison, although it took three days to pick the jury. On the witness stand, the surviving filmmakers managed to avoid admitting to Ison&#x2019;s lawyers that it was the appalling poverty of his tenants that had interested them; they talked about being attracted by expressive family groups and by the convenience of not having to move their equipment far from the road. The defense asked if they were planning to take pictures of the Bluegrass as well as Appalachia. Were they going to make a lot of money from the film? How many millions of viewers would see the pictures of poor Eastern Kentucky people? Had they refused to move? Had they taunted Ison by saying he was shooting blanks? Did the people who signed the release forms really know what they were signing? (At least one of the signers was, like one out of four of his neighbors, unable to read.)</p><h2>The Murder Book of J. G. Reeder</h2><p>1925. Edgar Wallace established his reputation as a writer of detective thrillers, a genre in which he wrote more than 170 books, with the publication of The Four Just Men. This book is a collection of eight short stories presenting his most memorable character, the honorable Mr. J. G. Reeder of the Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office in London.

See other titles by this author available from Kessinger Publishing.</p><p>Richard Horatio Edgar Wallace was born illegitimately in Greenwich, London, in 1875 to actors Mary Jane Richards and T.H. Edgar. As an infant he was adopted by George Freeman, a porter at Billingsgate fish market. Aged eleven, Wallace sold newspapers at Ludgate Circus and upon leaving school took a job with a printer. He later enlisted in the Royal West Kent Regiment, before transferring to the Medical Staff Corps, and was sent to South Africa. In 1898, he published a collection of poems called &#39;The Mission that Failed&#39;, and subsequently left the army to become correspondent for Reuters. South African war correspondent for &#39;The Daily Mail&#39; followed and his articles were later published as &#39;Unofficial Dispatches&#39;. His outspokenness infuriated Lord Kitchener, who removed his credentials. He then edited the &#39;Rand Daily Mail&#39;, but gambled disastrously on the South African Stock Market. Returning to England, Wallace at first reported on crimes and hanging trials, before becoming editor of &#39;The Evening News&#39;. It was in 1905 that he founded the Tallis Press, publishing &#39;Smithy&#39;, a collection of soldier stories, and &#39;The Four Just Men&#39;. The latter was published with the ending removed as an advertising stunt and he offered oe500 to readers who could successfully guess the ending. Unfortunately, many did and he was almost bankrupted. At various times Wallace also worked as a journalist on &#39;The Standard&#39;, &#39;The Star&#39;, &#39;The Week-End Racing Supplement&#39; and &#39;The Story Journal&#39;. In 1917, he became a Special Constable at Lincoln&#39;s Inn and also a special interrogator for the War Office. The Daily Mail sent Wallace to investigate atrocities in the Belgian Congo, a trip that provided material for his &#39;Sanders of the River&#39; books. In 1923, he became Chairman of the Press Club and in 1931 stood as a Liberal Parliamentary candidate for Blackpool. Wallace&#39;s first marriage in 1901 to Ivy Caldecott, daughter of a missionary, ended in divorce in 1918 and he later married his much younger secretary, Violet King. Along with countless articles, some 23 screenplays and many short stories, Wallace wrote more than 170 books, which have been translated into 28 languages and sales of which have exceeded 50 million copies. Over 160 films have been made from his books - more than any other author. In the 1920&#39;s one of Wallace&#39;s many publishers claimed that a quarter of all books read in England were written by him. His sales were exceeded only by &#39;The Bible&#39;. He died in 1932 whilst working on the screenplay for &#39;King Kong&#39;, having moved to Hollywood after being offered a contract by RKO.</p><h2>Riding with the Lion: In Search of Mystical Christianity</h2><p>The author of Homage to the Sun journeys around the world to explore the vital, living world of Christian mysticism, a collection of practices and teachings based on ancient Christian traditions. 12,500 first printing.</p><p><b>Kyriacos C. Markides&nbsp;</b>has written several books about Christian mysticism, including&nbsp;<i>The Magus of Strovolos</i>,&nbsp;<i>Riding with the Lion</i>,<i>&nbsp;Homage to the Sun</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Fire in the Heart</i>. A professor of sociology at the University of Maine, he lives in Stillwater, Maine, with his wife, Emily.Despite his promising subtitle, Markides (sociology, Univ. of Maine) will disappoint readers interested in classical Christian mysticism. Anecdotal evidence for paranormal phenomena such as teleportation, clairvoyance, levitation, dematerialization, and channeling, along with a disorganized collage of references to Marx, Nietzsche, Plato, Huston Smith, P.D. Ouspensky, etc., are presented in the first part of the book. Markides does not succeed in his attempt to place New Age religion and paranormal psychology within the context of classical mysticism. Where he does succeed is in the account of his visit to the monasteries of Mount Athos on the coast of Greece and his encounter there with monks of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Libraries with collections in New Age materials and parapsychology will want to consider this book, but collections in Christian mysticism would be better served by such recent publications as Evelyn Underhill's classic Mysticism (Oxford Univ. Pr., 1993. reprint).<br><i>Linda V.

Published by Scholastic Press,2006, Binding: Paperback Reprint Edition</p><p>The long-awaited, eagerly anticipated, arguably over-hyped <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> has arrived, and the question on the minds of kids, adults, fans, and skeptics alike is, "Is it worth the hype?" The answer, luckily, is simple: yep. A magnificent spectacle more than worth the price of admission, <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> will blow you away. However, given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book (including armored trucks and injunctions), don't expect any spoilers in this review. It's much more fun not knowing what's coming--and in the case of Rowling's delicious sixth book, you don't want to know. Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won't stop until you reach the very last page. <p> A darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre, <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of Rowling onto the adult literary scene. While she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit, the strength of Book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters, as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. In <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i>, no one and nothing is safe, including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. With each book in her increasingly remarkable series, fans have nervously watched J.K. Rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy, and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. A series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. But this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. Rowling readied fans with <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i> by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. Still, there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of Book 6 that casts a mean shadow over Quidditch games, silly flirtations, and mountains of homework. Ready or not, the tremendous ending of <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> will leave stunned fans wondering what great and terrible events await in Book 7 if this sinister darkness is meant to light the way. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> </p><p> <strong>Visit the <i>Harry Potter</i> Store</strong> <br> Our <i>Harry Potter</i> Store features all things Harry, including books (box sets and collector's editions), audio CDs and cassettes, DVDs, soundtracks, games, and more. <br> <br> <strong>Begin at the Beginning</strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i><br> <br>Hardcover <br> Paperback </td> <td><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i><br><br>Hardcover<br>Paperback </td> <td><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i><br><br>Hardcover<br>Paperback </td> <td><i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i><br><br>Hardcover<br>Paperback </td> <td><i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i><br><br>Hardcover<br>Paperback </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br> <strong>Why We Love Harry</strong> <br> <i>Favorite Moments from the Series</i><br>There are plenty of reasons to love Rowling's wildly popular series--no doubt you have several dozen of your own. Our list features favorite moments, characters, and artifacts from the first five books. Keep in mind that this list is by no means exhaustive (what we love about Harry could fill ten books!) and does not include any of the spectacular revelatory moments that would spoil the books for those (few) who have not read them. Enjoy. <p><strong><i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Harry's first trip to the zoo with the Dursleys, when a boa constrictor winks at him. <br>* When the Dursleys' house is suddenly besieged by letters for Harry from Hogwarts. Readers learn how much the Dursleys have been keeping from Harry. Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists. <br>* Harry's first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid. Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel, Harry's first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders, where Harry gets his wand (holly and phoenix feather) and discovers yet another connection to He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. This moment is the reader's first full introduction to Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizards.<br>* Harry's experience with the Sorting Hat. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* The de-gnoming of the Weasleys' garden. Harry discovers that even wizards have chores--gnomes must be grabbed (ignoring angry protests "Gerroff me! Gerroff me!"), swung about (to make them too dizzy to come back), and tossed out of the garden--this delightful scene highlights Rowling's clever and witty genius. <br>* Harry's first experience with a Howler, sent to Ron by his mother. <br>* The Dueling Club battle between Harry and Malfoy. Gilderoy Lockhart starts the Dueling Club to help students practice spells on each other, but he is not prepared for the intensity of the animosity between Harry and Draco. Since they are still young, their minibattle is innocent enough, including tickling and dancing charms. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Ron's attempt to use a telephone to call Harry at the Dursleys'. <br>* Harry's first encounter with a Dementor on the train (and just about any other encounter with Dementors). Harry's brush with the Dementors is terrifying and prepares Potter fans for a darker, scarier book. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's behavior in Professor Trelawney's Divination class. Some of the best moments in Rowling's books occur when she reminds us that the wizards-in-training at Hogwarts are, after all, just children. Clearly, even at a school of witchcraft and wizardry, classes can be boring and seem pointless to children. <br>* The Boggart lesson in Professor Lupin's classroom. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's knock-down confrontation with Snape. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Hermione's disgust at the reception for the veela (Bulgarian National Team Mascots) at the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling's fourth book addresses issues about growing up--the dynamic between the boys and girls at Hogwarts starts to change. Nowhere is this more plain than the hilarious scene in which magical cheerleaders nearly convince Harry and Ron to jump from the stands to impress them. <br>* Viktor Krum's crush on Hermione--and Ron's objection to it. <br>* Malfoy's "Potter Stinks" badge. <br>* Hermione's creation of S.P.E.W., the intolerant bigotry of the Death Eaters, and the danger of the Triwizard Tournament. Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series. Candy and tickle spells are left behind as the students tackle darker, more serious issues and take on larger responsibilities, including the knowledge of illegal curses.</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i></strong><br> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td>* Harry's outburst to his friends at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming. <br>* Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge. Rowling shows her darker side, leading readers to believe that Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for young wizards. Dolores represents a bureaucratic tyrant capable of real evil, and Harry is forced to endure their private battle of wills alone. <br>* Harry and Cho's painfully awkward interactions. Rowling clearly remembers what it was like to be a teenager. <br>* Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape. <br>* Dumbledore's confession to Harry.</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> <strong>Magic, Mystery, and Mayhem: A Conversation with J.K.

She was abandoned by her father, possibly abused by her stepfather and lived on the streets as a teenager. As a club singer she had to contend with racism, sexism and advances from predatory men. But in the 1950s, just when Billie Holiday, from a similar background, was falling toward drug addiction and a sordid death, Fitzgerald escaped the seeming inevitability of that fate. Her songbook albums relaunched her career in a new direction, and she became a beloved figure in American jazz, known for her musical precision and luminous clarity. This biography offers an assessment of the emotional strength apparent in both her life and music.The life of the very private and media-shy Ella Fitzgerald has long been shrouded in a mixture of half-truths and fiction. What emerges in Stuart Nicholson&#39;s groundbreaking biography is a remarkable story of a poor black girl&#39;s determination to realize the American Dream in the face of racial and sexual prejudice. She succeeded, and is now the definition of &#34;jazz singer&#34; to millions, one of the greatest of all jazz musicians. In this fullest account ever of her life, Nicholson draws on fresh research and interviews with Ella&#39;s friends and colleagues. Supplemented by Phil Schaap&#39;s authoritative discography, Ella Fitzgerald is a rich and revealing portrait of one of the most popular American singers in history.</p><h2>Ayesha At Last: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong><em>Pride and Prejudice</em></strong><strong> with a modern twist&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AYESHA SHAMSI has&nbsp;<em>a lot&nbsp;</em>going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dreams of being a poet have been set aside for a teaching job so she can pay off her debts to her wealthy uncle.

His congregation was racially integrated, and he was a much-lauded leader in the contemporary civil rights movement. Eventually, Jones moved his church, Peoples Temple, to northern California. He became involved in electoral politics, and soon was a prominent Bay Area leader. <br>In this riveting narrative, Jeff Guinn examines Jones s life, from his extramarital affairs, drug use, and fraudulent faith healing to the fraught decision to move almost a thousand of his followers to a settlement in the jungles of Guyana in South America. Guinn provides stunning new details of the events leading to the fatal day in November, 1978 when more than nine hundred people died including almost three hundred infants and children after being ordered to swallow a cyanide-laced drink. <br>Guinn examined thousands of pages of FBI files on the case, including material released during the course of his research. He traveled to Jones s Indiana hometown, where he spoke to people never previously interviewed, and uncovered fresh information from Jonestown survivors. He even visited the Jonestown site with the same pilot who flew there the day that Congressman Leo Ryan was murdered on Jones s orders.<i> The Road to Jonestown</i> is the definitive book about Jim Jones and the events that led to the tragedy at Jonestown."</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2017:</strong> It&#x2019;s interesting that the dust jacket for <em>The Road to Jonestown</em>, Jeff Guinn&#x2019;s biography Jim Jones, features a photograph of the infamous preacher without his signature, nearly ubiquitous sunglasses. Despite the scale of the Jonestown tragedy &#x2013; where more than 900 people died, willingly or not, on November 18, 1978 &#x2013; the man behind the shades and his motivations have remained mysterious, in part because the event is simply hard to look at and difficult to comprehend. Longtime journalist Jeff Guinn, however, doesn&#x2019;t mind an occasional walk on the wild side. In the same way that his 2013 biography of Charles Manson dug deep to uncover the pivotal moments of the psychopath&#x2019;s past (it features a boyish, smiling proto-cult-mastermind on its own jacket), Guinn unmasks Jones through interviews with the people who themselves knew him, from townspeople to his parishioners to his the reverend&#x2019;s own family. The result is a dense read and full of detail, but none superfluous. Images of a 12-year-old walking Indiana backroads - black suit-clad and a bible in hand &#x2013; and conducting imaginary funeral services alone, in the woods, are weird and indelible. As we witness Jones&#x2019;s ascent - driven by a blend of well-honed charisma and inclusive, Marxist ideals - then his fall into megalomania and madness, it all makes a little more sense &#x2013; at least as much as monstrosity at such scale can. The jungles of Guyana may have reclaimed the site of one of the 20th century&#x2019;s most notorious crime scenes, but <em>The Road to Jonestown</em> answers many of the questions that have persisted for almost 40 years, foremost: How did this happen? But another one remains: After Manson and Jones, where does Guinn go from here? <em>--Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em>Jeff Guinn is a former award-winning investigative journalist and the bestselling author of numerous books, including <i>Go Down Together: The True Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde, The Last Gunfight: The Real Story of the Shootout at the O.K.

In their search for an easy technique they could implement in their own home, they came across French artist �milie Aizier-Brouard&#39;s ingenious Kitchen Lithography, which uses aluminum foil, cola, and oil-based crayons as its main materials, and quickly became ardent fans of and experts in the process, which is eco-friendly, inexpensive, and easy to do. In this book, the first on the subject, they share what they&#39;ve learned through a process of trial and error in an easy-to-follow guide on turning your kitchen into a creative studio. Hand print your own buttons, bags, pillowcases, posters, cards, T-shirts, and labels using simple household ingredients with surprising and bold results.</p><p>Lucas Grassmann and Laura Sofie Hantke studied graphic design at the University of Applied Sciences in Darmstadt, Germany. Since they graduated in 2013 and 2015 respectively, Grassmann has worked as a freelancer for various clients and Hantke as a freelance illustrator and graphic designer. In 2015, they started working together and founded Studio Lula (studio-lula.com)."In their quest to find a printmaking method that didn't require a studio with high-end supplies, designers Hantke and Grassmann discovered kitchen lithography, which uses common household items such as aluminum foil, vegetable oil, and cola to create simple printing plates. Their guide walks crafters through the process of creating and etching the printing plate and using the plate to make prints on a variety of surfaces. The authors cover both single-color and multicolor printing, extending the life of the printing plate using gum arabic, and troubleshooting printmaking problems. VERDICT Crafters interested in exploring printmaking without investing a lot of money in pricey supplies will be fascinated by the high-quality results produced by kitchen lithography. Since the technique is so easy and the supplies are nontoxic, it's also a fun rainy-day art project for older children." <br> - Library Journal<br><br>"Remember back in Art class when you did those Lino prints? Well, this is similar, but lots more fun and way more artistic. The best thing is your weird Art teacher isn't going to grade you down for thinking outside the box this time. I really love when a Craft enables you to be creative from your own insides and not anyone else's.

The car contained one million dollars in ransom money. And Edward Lane, the man who paid it, will pay even more to get his family back. Lane runs a highly illegal soldiers-for-hire operation. He will use any amount of money and any tool to find his beautiful wife and child. And then he&#x2019;ll turn Jack Reacher loose with a vengeance - because Reacher is the best man hunter in the world. On the trail of a vicious kidnapper, Reacher is learning the chilling secrets of his employer&#x2019;s past...and of a horrific drama in the heart of a nasty little war. He&#x2019;s beginning to realize that Edward Lane is hiding something. Something dirty. Something big. But Reacher also knows this: he&#x2019;s already in way too deep to stop now.</p><p>LEE CHILD is the author of ten Jack Reacher thrillers, including the New York Times bestsellers Persuader, the Barry Award Winner The Enemy, and One Shot, which has been optioned for a major motion picture by Paramount Pictures.

Not that the waiter was slow. Just that the move was slick. So slick, Reacher had no idea what he was watching. It was just an urban scene, repeated everywhere in the world a billion times a day: A guy unlocked a car and got in and drove away. That was all.<br><br>But that was enough.<br><br>The espresso had been close to perfect, so Reacher went back to the same cafe&#x17d; exactly -twenty--four hours later. Two nights in the same place was unusual for Reacher, but he figured great coffee was worth a change in his routine. The caf� was on the west side of Sixth Avenue in New York City, in the middle of the block between Bleecker and Houston. It occupied the ground floor of an undistinguished -four--story building. The upper stories looked like anonymous rental apartments. The cafe itself looked like a transplant from a back street in Rome. Inside it had low light and scarred wooden walls and a dented chrome machine as hot and long as a locomotive, and a counter. Outside there was a single line of metal tables on the sidewalk behind a low canvas screen. Reacher took the same end table he had used the night before and chose the same seat. He stretched out and got comfortable and tipped his chair up on two legs. That put his back against the cafe's outside wall and left him looking east, across the sidewalk and the width of the avenue. He liked to sit outside in the summer, in New York City. Especially at night. He liked the electric darkness and the hot dirty air and the blasts of noise and traffic and the manic barking sirens and the crush of people. It helped a lonely man feel connected and isolated both at the same time.<br><br>He was served by the same waiter as the night before and ordered the same drink, double espresso in a foam cup, no sugar, no spoon. He paid for it as soon as it arrived and left his change on the table. That way he could leave exactly when he wanted to without insulting the waiter or bilking the owner or stealing the china. Reacher always arranged the smallest details in his life so he could move on at a split second's notice. It was an obsessive habit. He owned nothing and carried nothing. Physically he was a big man, but he cast a small shadow and left very little in his wake.<br><br>He drank his coffee slowly and felt the night heat come up off the sidewalk. He watched cars and people. Watched taxis flow north and garbage trucks pause at the curbs. Saw knots of strange young people heading for clubs. Watched girls who had once been boys totter south. Saw a blue German sedan park on the block. Watched a compact man in a gray suit get out and walk north. Watched him thread between two sidewalk tables and head inside to where the cafe staff was clustered in back. Watched him ask them questions.<br><br>The guy was medium height, not young, not old, too solid to be called wiry, too slight to be called heavy. His hair was gray at the temples and cut short and neat. He kept himself balanced on the balls of his feet. His mouth didn't move much as he talked. But his eyes did. They flicked left and right tirelessly. The guy was about forty, Reacher guessed, and furthermore Reacher guessed he had gotten to be about forty by staying relentlessly aware of everything that was happening around him. Reacher had seen the same look in elite infantry veterans who had survived long jungle tours.<br><br>Then Reacher's waiter turned suddenly and pointed straight at him. The compact man in the gray suit stared over. Reacher stared back, over his shoulder, through the window. Eye contact was made. Without breaking it the man in the suit mouthed <i>thank you</i> to the waiter and started back out the way he had entered. He stepped through the door and made a right inside the low canvas screen and threaded his way down to Reacher's table. Reacher let him stand there mute for a moment while he made up his mind. Then he said "Yes," to him, like an answer, not a question.<br><br>"Yes what?" the guy said back.<br><br>"Yes whatever," Reacher said. "Yes I'm having a pleasant evening, yes you can join me, yes you can ask me whatever it is you want to ask me."<br><br>The guy scraped a chair out and sat down, his back to the river of traffic, blocking Reacher's view.<br><br>"Actually I do have a question," he said.<br><br>"I know," Reacher said. "About last night."<br><br>"How did you know that?" The guy's voice was low and quiet and his accent was flat and clipped and British.<br><br>"The waiter pointed me out," Reacher said. "And the only thing that distinguishes me from his other customers is that I was here last night and they weren't."<br><br>"You're certain about that?"<br><br>"Turn your head away," Reacher said. "Watch the traffic."<br><br>The guy turned his head away. Watched the traffic.<br><br>"Now tell me what I'm wearing," Reacher said.<br><br>"Green shirt," the British guy said. "Cotton, baggy, cheap, doesn't look new, sleeves rolled to the elbow, over a green T-shirt, also cheap and not new, a little tight, untucked over -flat--front khaki chinos, no socks, English shoes, pebbled leather, brown, not new, but not very old either, probably expensive. Frayed laces, like you pull on them too hard when you tie them. Maybe indicative of a -self--discipline obsession."<br><br>"OK," Reacher said.<br><br>"OK what?"<br><br>"You notice things," Reacher said. "And I notice things. We're two of a kind. We're peas in a pod. I'm the only customer here now who was also here last night. I'm certain of that. And that's what you asked the staff. Had to be. That's the only reason the waiter would have pointed me out."<br><br>The guy turned back.<br><br>"Did you see a car last night?" he asked.<br><br>"I saw plenty of cars last night," Reacher said. "This is Sixth Avenue."<br><br>"A Mercedes Benz. Parked over there." The guy twisted again and pointed on a slight diagonal at a length of empty curb by a fire hydrant on the other side of the street.<br><br>Reacher said, "Silver, four-door sedan, an S-420, New York vanity plates starting OSC, a lot of city miles on it. Dirty paint, scuffed tires, dinged rims, dents and scrapes on both bumpers."<br><br>The guy turned back again.<br><br>"You saw it," he said.<br><br>"It was right there," Reacher said. "Obviously I saw it."<br><br>"Did you see it leave?"<br><br>Reacher nodded. "Just before eleven -forty--five a guy got in and drove it away."<br><br>"You're not wearing a watch."<br><br>"I always know what time it is."<br><br>"It must have been closer to midnight."<br><br>"Maybe," Reacher said. "Whatever."<br><br>"Did you get a look at the driver?"<br><br>"I told you, I saw him get in and drive away."<br><br>The guy stood up.<br><br>"I need you to come with me," he said. Then he put his hand in his pocket. "I'll buy your coffee."<br><br>"I already paid for it."<br><br>"So let's go."<br><br>"Where?"<br><br>"To see my boss."<br><br>"Who's your boss?"<br><br>"A man called Lane."<br><br>"You're not a cop," Reacher said. "That's my guess. Based on observation."<br><br>"Of what?"<br><br>"Your accent. You're not American. You're British. The NYPD isn't that desperate."<br><br>"Most of us are Americans," the British guy said. "But you're right, we're not cops. We're private citizens."<br><br>"What kind?"<br><br>"The kind that will make it worth your while if you give them a description of the individual who drove that car away."<br><br>"Worth my while how?"<br><br>"Financially," the guy said. "Is there any other way?"<br><br>"Lots of other ways," Reacher said. "I think I'll stay right here."<br><br>"This is very serious."<br><br>"How?"<br><br>The guy in the suit sat down again.<br><br>"I can't tell you that," he said.<br><br>"Goodbye," Reacher said.<br><br>"Not my choice," the guy said. "Mr. Lane made it -mission--critical that nobody knows. For very good reasons."<br><br>Reacher tilted his cup and checked the contents. Nearly gone.<br><br>"You got a name?" he asked.<br><br>"Do you?"<br><br>"You first."<br><br>In response the guy stuck a thumb into the breast pocket of his suit coat and slid out a black leather business card holder. He opened it up and used the same thumb to slide out a single card. He passed it across the table. It was a handsome item. Heavy linen stock, raised lettering, ink that still looked wet. At the top it said: <i>Operational Security Consultants</i>.<br><br>"OSC," Reacher said. "Like the license plate."<br><br>The British guy said nothing.<br><br>Reacher smiled. "You're security consultants and you got your car stolen? I can see how that could be embarrassing."<br><br>The guy said, "It's not the car we're worried about."<br>Lower down on the business card was a name: <i>John Gregory</i>. Under the name was a subscript: <i>British Army, Retired</i>. Then a job title: <i>Executive Vice President</i>.<br><br>"How long have you been out?" Reacher asked.<br><br>"Of the British Army?" the guy called Gregory said. "Seven years."<br><br>"Unit?"<br><br>"SAS."<br><br>"You've still got the look."<br><br>"You too," Gregory said. "How long have you been out?"<br><br>"Seven years," Reacher said.<br><br>"Unit?"<br><br>"U.S. Army CID, mostly."<br><br>Gregory looked up. Interested. "Investigator?"<br><br>"Mostly."...</p><h2>Jailbird : a novel</h2><p><b>Jailbird </b>takes us into a fractured and comic, pure Vonnegut world of high crimes and misdemeanors in government...and in the heart.

Celebrate the return of classic Baltimore patterns! These smaller blocks make for easier, more portable quilt projects that you and yours will cherish for years to come.</p><p>Elly&#39;s path from career woman to stay-at-home mom of three, led her to become an early professional in the nascent quilt movement of the early 70s. Elly notes that her Wellesley College Class of 1964 is a &#34;cusp generation&#34; - women who as freshmen expected to live their mothers&#39; 1950s societal ideal, but who were the object of radically different expectations by the time they graduated. Elly herself earned a Masters of Science degree and taught high school for seven years. A history major with a lifetime love of needleart, Elly&#39;s traditionalist desire to stay at home once her children arrived led to home-centered enterprises related to the burgeoning quilt world industry. Her experiences range from quilting teacher, to retail mail-order proprietess, to respected quiltmaker, to author, historian, and president of the Elly Sienkiewicz Applique Academy. Elly&#39;s devotion as a teacher, her concern for her students and her love for quiltmaking have made her a cherished mentor. She lives in Washington, D.C. with her husband Stan, and, whenever they can be there too, their children and grandchildren.It is always exciting news in the applique world when Elly Sienkiewicz comes out with a new book. In Elly Sienkiuewicz&#39;s Beloved Baltimore Album Quilts we find 25 blocks, 12 quilts for inspiration and numerous embellishment techniques. Album quilts are perhaps the most glorious of all applique quilts. The blocks are often done by many different stitchers and contain symbols that are representative of our culture, both past and present. All the patterns in the book are from the Happiness is in the Journey quilt, one of the quilts from the Houston Special Exhibit. They are sized at 8x8 finished. There is an enlargement chart for those of you who would like to work in a larger size format. You will find wonderful photos and illustrations for various applique techniques from beginning basics to such techniques as weaving fabric for baskets and creating dimensional flowers. Art materials covered include: threads, fabric manipulation, beads and acrylic paints and inks. I also liked the instruction on creating a dog tooth border. The quilts at the 2010 Houston Special Exhibit started from a grain of an idea Elly had in the middle of the night. Over the course of 3 years (2007-2010), 245 volunteers from 36 states and 5 countries created 12 Baltimore Album quilts. The twelve quilts plus an additional 28 quilts from around the world made up the 2010 Houston Special Exhibit. The block makers names are listed along with a map of the quilt to help the reader locate the specific block in the photo of the quilt. I am sure there are names you will recognize. This is a MUST have book for your applique book library, and will be a great resource for both the beginner and the more experienced artist.</p><h2>Words Apart and Others</h2><p>Poetry. Translated and edited by Vyt Bakaitis. The Brooklyn Rail is excited to present a two-part publication WORDS APART AND OTHERS / MESSAGE AHEAD, from Rail Editions, which celebrates the poetry and artistic legacy of pioneering filmmaker Jonas Mekas (b.1922 Semeni&#x161;kiai, Lithuania). WORDS APART AND OTHERS is translated and edited by long-time translator and poet Vyt Bakaitis, who brings poems spanning three decades of Mekas's career (1967-1998) to English audiences for the first time. The book opens with a timely and discerning preface by poet Anne Waldman.<br><br>"In his poems, Jonas Mekas, the legendary filmmaker and artist, takes a Dantean journey down through the circles that surround the self. And like Dante, instead of seeing horizontally from some fixed place to the horizon, Mekas sees vertically, but from the lit world into the depths of experience. Besides enacting a vertiginous examination of the meaning of a life, the striking verticality of his lines functions like an auger 'going / deeper, / deeper / in.'"--Forrest Gander<br><br>"Just like his films, Jonas Mekas's poems hold his dignity, their pace unfolding as the poet looks down at mountains from a plane. Later he's a bit of an actor sitting on the shore, anticipating darkness, uses 'soul' as singular, remembers being little and those old friends and then it is day, bright yellow and he is beginning again. The colors here are true, the experience is so real. Mekas's poems are a plain joy to read, timely and refreshing like a perfect glass of water."--Eileen Myles</p><p>Jonas Mekas (b.1922 Semeni&#x161;kiai, Lithuania) is the widely renowned filmmaker of radical means. While his first book of poems, published seven decades ago, has established itself as a classic, he continues to maintain a proliferating, vigorous presence in Lithuanian letters. A new book of poems he has written in English, <em>The Book of Her</em>, is soon to appear.</p><h2>Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in Her Time</h2><p>Follows the singer&#39;s rise from poverty and obscurity to international stardom against the backdrop of 1920&#39;s Paris and a Europe in the shadow of Hilter, and recounts her later civil rights activism and many adoptions</p><p>With the searching intellectuality that has distinguished her literary biographies, Rose ( Parallel Lives ) takes on what is for her a surprising subject: the life and work of American expatriate dancer, singer and entertainer Josephine Baker. Born in 1906 in St. Louis, Mo., Baker--whose roots were black and Native American--had endured the early departure of her father, abuse as a domestic servant in the homes of white people and the brutal East St. Louis race riots of 1917 before her childhood was over. The ethos of jazz--freedom--offered her a way out. Employed at 13 as a dresser for a touring black vaudeville show, Baker graduated into the chorus lines of other such troupes until recruited in 1925 to dance in a black revue to be launched in Paris. There her brilliantly uninhibited performances won her immediate and lasting fame ("Hips, stomach, and rump had never moved so violently"). Not simply the story of a complex and influential woman, this indispensable biography treats in full the two cultures--American and Continental--that formed Baker, and sets a new standard for critical studies of performing artists.

The governess was always getting muddled with her astrolabe, and when she got specially muddled she would take it out of the Wart by rapping his knuckles. She did not rap Kay&#x2019;s knuckles, because when Kay grew older he would be Sir Kay, the master of the estate. The Wart was called the Wart because it more or less rhymed with Art, which was short for his real name. Kay had given him the nickname. Kay was not called anything but Kay, as he was too dignified to have a nickname and would have flown into a passion if anybody had tried to give him one. The governess had red hair and some mysterious wound from which she derived a lot of prestige by showing it to all the women of the castle, behind closed doors. It was believed to be where she sat down, and to have been caused by sitting on some armour at a picnic by mistake. Eventually she offered to show it to Sir Ector, who was Kay&#x2019;s father, had hysterics and was sent away. They found out afterwards that she had been in a lunatic hospital for three years.</p><p>In the afternoons the programme was: Mondays and Fridays, tilting and horsemanship; Tuesdays, hawking; Wednesdays, fencing; Thursdays, archery; Saturdays, the theory of chivalry, with the proper measures to be blown on all occasions, terminology of the chase and hunting etiquette. If you did the wrong thing at the mort or the undoing, for instance, you were bent over the body of the dead beast and smacked with the flat side of a sword. This was called being bladed. It was horseplay, a sort of joke like being shaved when crossing the line. Kay was not bladed, although he often went wrong.</p><p>When they had got rid of the governess, Sir Ector said, &#x201c;After all, damn it all, we can&#x2019;t have the boys runnin&#x2019; about all day like hooligans&#x2014;after all, damn it all? Ought to be havin&#x2019; a first-rate eddication, at their age. When I was their age I was doin&#x2019; all this Latin and stuff at five o&#x2019;clock every mornin&#x2019;. Happiest time of me life. Pass the port.&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Grummore Grummursum, who was staying the night because he had been benighted out questin&#x2019; after a specially long run, said that when he was their age he was swished every mornin&#x2019; because he would go hawkin&#x2019; instead of learnin&#x2019;. He attributed to this weakness the fact that he could never get beyond the Future Simple of Utor. It was a third of the way down the left-hand leaf, he said. He thought it was leaf ninety-seven. He passed the port.</p><p>Sir Ector said, &#x201c;Had a good quest today?&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Grummore said, &#x201c;Oh, not so bad. Rattlin&#x2019; good day, in fact. Found a chap called Sir Bruce Saunce Pit� choppin&#x2019; off a maiden&#x2019;s head in Weedon Bushes, ran him to Mixbury Plantation in the Bicester, where he doubled back, and lost him in Wicken Wood. Must have been a good twenty-five miles as he ran.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A straight-necked &#x2019;un,&#x201d; said Sir Ector.</p><p>&#x201c;But about these boys and all this Latin and that,&#x201d; added the old gentleman. &#x201c;Amo, amas, you know, and runnin&#x2019; about like hooligans: what would you advise?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, laying his finger by his nose and winking at the bottle, &#x201c;that takes a deal of thinkin&#x2019; about, if you don&#x2019;t mind my sayin&#x2019; so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind at all,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;Very kind of you to say anythin&#x2019;. Much obliged, I&#x2019;m sure. Help yourself to port.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good port this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get it from a friend of mine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But about these boys,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;How many of them are there, do you know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;counting them both, that is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t send them to Eton, I suppose?&#x201d; inquired Sir Grummore cautiously. &#x201c;Long way and all that, we know.&#x201d;</p><p>It was not really Eton that he mentioned, for the College of Blessed Mary was not founded until 1440, but it was a place of the same sort. Also they were drinking Metheglyn, not port, but by mentioning the modern wine it is easier to give you the feel.</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t so much the distance,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;but that giant What&#x2019;s-&#x2019;is-name is in the way. Have to pass through his country, you understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is his name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t recollect it at the moment, not for the life of me. Fellow that lives by the Burbly Water.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Galapas,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the very chap.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The only other thing,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;is to have a tutor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean a fellow who teaches you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;A tutor, you know, a fellow who teaches you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have some more port,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;You need it after all this questin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Splendid day,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;Only they never seem to kill nowadays. Run twenty-five miles and then mark to ground or lose him altogether. The worst is when you start a fresh quest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We kill all our giants cubbin&#x2019;,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;After that they give you a fine run, but get away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Run out of scent,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;I dare say. It&#x2019;s always the same with these big giants in a big country. They run out of scent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But even if you was to have a tutor,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how you would get him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Advertise,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>&#x201c;I have advertised,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;It was cried by the <i>Humberland Newsman and Cardoile Advertiser</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The only other way,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;is to start a quest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean a quest for a tutor,&#x201d; explained Sir Ector.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hic, Haec, Hoc,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;Have some more of this drink, whatever it calls itself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hunc,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>So it was decided. When Grummore Grummursum had gone home next day, Sir Ector tied a knot in his handkerchief to remember to start a quest for a tutor as soon as he had time to do so, and, as he was not sure how to set about it, he told the boys what Sir Grummore had suggested and warned them not to be hooligans meanwhile. Then they went hay-making.</p><p>It was July, and every able-bodied man and woman on the estate worked during that month in the field, under Sir Ector&#x2019;s direction. In any case the boys would have been excused from being eddicated just then.</p><p>Sir Ector&#x2019;s castle stood in an enormous clearing in a still more enormous forest. It had a courtyard and a moat with pike in it. The moat was crossed by a fortified stone bridge which ended half-way across it. The other half was covered by a wooden drawbridge which was wound up every night. As soon as you had crossed the drawbridge you were at the top of the village street&#x2014;it had only one street&#x2014;and this extended for about half a mile, with thatched houses of wattle and daub on either side of it. The street divided the clearing into two huge fields, that on the left being cultivated in hundreds of long narrow strips, while that on the right ran down to a river and was used as pasture. Half of the right-hand field was fenced off for hay.</p><p>It was July, and real July weather, such as they had in Old England. Everybody went bright brown, like Red Indians, with startling teeth and flashing eyes. The dogs moved about with their tongues hanging out, or lay panting in bits of shade, while the farm horses sweated through their coats and flicked their tails and tried to kick the horse-flies off their bellies with their great hind hoofs. In the pasture field the cows were on the gad, and could be seen galloping about with their tails in the air, which made Sir Ector angry.</p><p>Sir Ector stood on the top of a rick, whence he could see what everybody was doing, and shouted commands all over the two-hundred-acre field, and grew purple in the face. The best mowers mowed away in a line where the grass was still uncut, their scythes roaring in the strong sunlight. The women raked the dry hay together in long strips with wooden rakes, and the two boys with pitchforks followed up on either side of the strip, turning the hay inwards so that it lay well for picking up. Then the great carts followed, rumbling with their spiked wooden wheels, drawn by horses or slow white oxen. One man stood on top of the cart to receive the hay and direct operations, while one man walked on either side picking up what the boys had prepared and throwing it to him with a fork. The cart was led down the lane between two lines of hay, and was loaded in strict rotation from the front poles to the back, the man on top calling out in a stern voice where he wanted each fork to be pitched. The loaders grumbled at the boys for not having laid the hay properly and threatened to tan them when they caught them, if they got left behind.</p><p>When the wagon was loaded, it was drawn to Sir Ector&#x2019;s rick and pitched to him. It came up easily because it had been loaded systematically&#x2014;not like modern hay&#x2014;and Sir Ector scrambled about on top, getting in the way of his assistants, who did the real work, and stamping and perspiring and scratching about with his fork and trying to make the rick grow straight and shouting that it would all fall down as soon as the west winds came.</p><p>The Wart loved hay-making, and was good at it. Kay, who was two years older, generally stood on the edge of the bundle which he was trying to pick up, with the result that he worked twice as hard as the Wart for only half the result. But he hated to be beaten at anything, and used to fight away with the wretched hay&#x2014;which he loathed like poison&#x2014;until he was quite sick.</p><p>The day after Sir Grummore&#x2019;s visit was sweltering for the men who toiled from milking to milking and then again till sunset in their battle with the sultry element. For the hay was an element to them, like sea or air, in which they bathed and plunged themselves and which they even breathed in. The seeds and small scraps stuck in their hair, their mouths, their nostrils, and worked, tickling, inside their clothes. They did not wear many clothes, and the shadows between their sliding muscles were blue on the nut-brown skins. Those who feared thunder had felt ill that morning.</p><p>In the afternoon the storm broke. Sir Ector kept them at it till the great flashes were right overhead, and then, with the sky as dark as night, the rain came hurling against them so that they were drenched at once and could not see a hundred yards. The boys lay crouched under the wagons, wrapped in hay to keep their wet bodies warm against the now cold wind, and all joked with one another while heaven fell. Kay was shivering, though not with cold, but he joked like the others because he would not show he was afraid. At the last and greatest thunderbolt every man startled involuntarily, and each saw the other startle, until they laughed away their shame.</p><p>But that was the end of the hay-making and the beginning of play. The boys were sent home to change their clothes. The old dame who had been their nurse fetched dry jerkins out of a press, and scolded them for catching their deaths, and denounced Sir Ector for keeping on so long. Then they slipped their heads into the laundered shirts, and ran out to the refreshed and sparkling court.</p><p>&#x201c;I vote we take Cully and see if we can get some rabbits in the chase,&#x201d; cried the Wart.</p><p>&#x201c;The rabbits will not be out in this wet,&#x201d; said Kay sarcastically, delighted to have caught him over natural history.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, come on. It will soon be dry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I must carry Cully, then.&#x201d;</p><p>Kay insisted on carrying the goshawk and flying her, when they went hawking together. This he had a right to do, not only because he was older than the Wart but also because he was Sir Ector&#x2019;s proper son. The Wart was not a proper son. He did not understand this, but it made him feel unhappy, because Kay seemed to regard it as making him inferior in some way. Also it was different not having a father and mother, and Kay had taught him that being different was wrong. Nobody talked to him about it, but he thought about it when he was alone, and was distressed. He did not like people to bring it up. Since the other boy always did bring it up when a question of precedence arose, he had got into the habit of giving in at once before it could be mentioned. Besides, he admired Kay and was a born follower. He was a hero-worshipper.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, then,&#x201d; cried the Wart, and they scampered off toward the Mews, turning a few cartwheels on the way.</p></p><h2>Maus (Penguin Graphic Fiction) (Pt. 2)</h2><p>Maus II: A Survivor&#39;s Tale:And Here my Troubles Began (Penguin Graphic Fiction) 9780140132069</p><p>Art Spiegelman is a contributing editor and artist for the New Yorker.

In the mid-1990s, as the global media stirred up a panic about the risks of genetically modified crops, Lynas destroyed crop fields and spoke out in the press...until he realized he was wrong. This book explains why.</p><p>Twenty years after GMO crops became a source of controversy, scientists are working hard to devise new farming methods that will meet the world's food requirements while causing the minimum amount of ecological harm. We're now discovering that the environmentalist mainstream might have misjudged the GMO issue completely, and as a consequence we have forfeited two decades' worth of scientific progress in perhaps the most vital area of human need: food. </p><p>No one is more aware of this fact than Mark Lynas. Starting out as one of the leading activists in the fight against GMOs-from destroying experimental crop fields to leading the charge in the press-in 2013 Lynas famously admitted that he got it all wrong. Lynas takes us back to the origins of the technology, and examines the histories of the people and companies who pioneered it. He explains what lead him to question his assumptions on GMOs, and how he is currently tracking poverty by using genetic modification to encourage better harvests.</p><p><i>Seeds of Science</i> provides an explanation of the research that has enabled this technology-something which led to countless misconceptions about a field that could provide perhaps the only solution to a planet with a population of ten billion people.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark Lynas</b> is the author of three major popular science environmental books: <i>High Tide</i> (2004), <i>Six Degrees</i> (2008) and <i>The God Species</i> (2011), as well as the Kindle Single ebook <i>Nuclear 2.0</i> (2012). <i>Six Degrees</i> won the Royal Society prize and was made into a <i>National Geographic</i> documentary. </p><p>Lynas was advisor on climate change to the President of the Maldives from 2009 until the coup in 2012.

Wodehouse wrote mysteries, they would probably be very much like the books that Charlotte MacLeod writes, featuring the charming art detective Max Bittersohn and his socially connected wife, Sarah Kelling. There would be lots of style and witty dialogue, people with names like Tweeters Arbuthnot and Calpurnia Zickery, but not much meaty content.<p> MacLeod's latest mystery meringue begins at a fancy Boston wedding staged by Sarah for Max's nephew, where missing rubies, long-lost neighbors, the crash of a hot air balloon, and the discovery of a dead body are last-minute additions to the festivities. Things go downhill from there, with smoke bombs going off, more corpses piling up, and both Max and his 3-year-old son, Davy, soon among the missing. This is the kind of book that requires a dozen pages in the last chapter to explain everything, and that should be read with little finger firmly extended.

In <i>The Theater of Operations</i>, Joseph Masco locates the origins of the present-day U.S. counterterrorism apparatus in the Cold War's "balance of terror." He shows how, after the attacks of 9/11, the U.S. global War on Terror mobilized a wide range of affective, conceptual, and institutional resources established during the Cold War to enable a new planetary theater of operations. Tracing how specific aspects of emotional management, existential danger, state secrecy, and threat awareness have evolved as core aspects of the American social contract, Masco draws on archival, media, and ethnographic resources to offer a new portrait of American national security culture. Undemocratic and unrelenting, this counterterror state prioritizes speculative practices over facts, and ignores everyday forms of violence across climate, capital, and health in an unprecedented effort to anticipate and eliminate terror threats&#x2014;real, imagined, and emergent.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Joseph Masco is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago. He is the author of <i>The Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post&#x2013;Cold War New Mexico</i>, winner of the J. I. Staley Prize from the School for Advanced Research and the Rachel Carson Prize from the Society for the Social Studies of Science.<br>"Joseph Masco's brilliance lies in his ability to make visible the complex affective and discursive technologies that emerged from the long history of the Cold War, and to illuminate their effects on our everyday perceptions of security and harm. This much-anticipated book will be read widely in cultural anthropology and cultural studies. It is beautifully written and argued. That one leaves The Theater of Operations a bit paranoid is a tribute to Masco's rhetorical skill."<br> (Elizabeth A. Povinelli, author of <i>Economies of Abandonment: Social Belonging and Endurance in Late Liberalism</i>)<br><br>"We know that in the Cold War transportation infrastructures boomed, electronic infrastructures had to be hardened. We know about weapons and counter-weapons; we even have learned about the astonishing proliferation of security mechanisms put in place during the War on Terror. What Joseph Masco shows us in <i>The Theater of Operations</i> is an entire affective structure&#x2014;the management of anxiety, resilience, steadfastness, sacrifice&#x2014;that is demanded of every citizen. Alert to liquid containers above 2.4 ounces, hypervigilant to abandoned bags, suspicious loitering, or the detonation of a thermonuclear weapon&#x2014;we learn to live our lives aware of tiny and apocalyptic things. With an anthropologist's eye long attuned to life in the para-wartime state, Masco is the perfect guide to the theater of our lives in the security state."<br> (Peter Galison, author of <i>Einstein's Clocks, Poincar�'s Maps: Empires of Time</i>)</p><h2>Irish Records: Sources for Family and Local History, Revised Edition</h2><p>The best source for tracking down records in Ireland.<p>Irish Records is your guide to locating Irish genealogical sources in Ireland.</p><p>For the period of greatest interest to family history researchers -- the late eighteenth and early to middle nineteenth centuries -- Irish family records are sparse.

He taps into one last great scam: directing and producing a porn film. To make it work, he needs bedfellows: the lovely Nikki Fuller-Smith, a student with ambition, ego, and troubles to rival his own; old pal Mark Renton; and a motley crew that includes the neighborhood's favorite ex-beverage salesman, "Juice" Terry. In the world of <i>Porno</i>, however, even the cons are conned. Sick Boy and Renton jockey for top dog. The out-of-jail and in-for-revenge Begbie is on the loose. But it's the hapless, drug-addled Spud who may be spreading the most trouble. <i>Porno</i> is a novel about the <i>Trainspotting</i> crew ten years further down the line: still scheming, still scamming, still fighting for the first-class seats as the train careens at high velocity with derailment looming around the next corner.</p><p><i>Porno</i>, Irvine Welsh's highly entertaining--though completely unnecessary--sequel to his cult classic, <i>Trainspotting</i>, reunites the gang as they pursue another big-payoff scheme. It's been 10 years since Mark Renton walked away with the cash from a drug sale perpetrated by himself and his mates, Simon "Sick Boy" Williamson, Danny "Spud" Murphy, and Francis Begbie. The megalomaniacal Sick Boy has returned to Edinburgh, where stag film producer "Juice" Terry Lawson has given him the idea for a bold new scam: to locally produce a high-end adult film. Lawson introduces Sick Boy to the beautiful and egocentric Nikki Fuller-Smith, a student and aspiring star. Passivity and self-destructive tendencies have left well-meaning junkie Spud poor and alone, while time has only intensified the anger of the psychotic Begbie, who's fresh out of prison, back in Edinburgh, and obsessed with taking revenge on Renton. Sick Boy locates and persuades Renton, a successful club owner in Amsterdam, to help him steal money for his new production company. From the book's multiple points of view, it's soon clear that everyone's running their own scam, making conflicts--and long-awaited confrontations--inevitable.<p> Welsh's brutally honest prose and gallery of likeable ne'er-do-wells are in full display here, but the novel feels somewhat superfluous. <i>Porno</i> adds little insight into the characters or events of <i>Trainspotting</i> and fails to match its invention or sense of purpose. However, the author's obvious affection for these characters and dedication to authentically rendered dialogue and setting elevate <i>Porno</i> above mere slapdash reworking. As the novel builds momentum, Welsh wonderfully communicates the intense bravado driving his reckless characters. During such moments of vitality and humor, <i>Porno</i> is superficial but undeniably charming. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>The explosive sequel to <b>Trainspotting</b> ? ten years down the line. <br> <br>Still scheming, still scamming ? it?s ten years later and the boys from <b>Trainspotting</b> are still trying to fight for the first-class seats as the locomotive careers at high speed towards the buffers. Simon ?Sick Boy? Williamson is back in his native Edinburgh after a spell in London. Having failed spectacularly as a hustler, pimp, husband, father and <br>businessman, he taps into an opportunity, which to him represents one last throw of the dice. <br> <br>For this scam to work, Sick Boy needs bedfellows. A desirable one may be the lovely Nicola Fuller-Smith, a young student with enough ambition, ego and troubles to rival his own. However, to realize his dream of directing and producing a pornographic movie, Sick Boy teams up with old pal and fellow exile Mark Renton and a motley crew that includes the city?s favourite ex-aerated-water-salesman, ?Juice? Terry Lawson. <br> <br>In the world of <b>Porno</b>, however, nothing is straightforward as Sick Boy and Renton find out that they have unresolved issues to address concerning the increasingly unhinged Frank Begbie, the troubled, drug-addled Spud, but, most of all, with each other. <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The Lincoln-Douglas Debates: The First Complete, Unexpurgated Text</h2><p>Published together in their original form for the first time, the seven Lincoln-Douglas debates are presented in their entirety, free of editing and embellishment.

It has long been regarded as the most useful book ever written for promoting a contented, thankful, uncomplaining and grateful walk with God. We live in a world of grumblers, discontent with God&#39;s widespread goodness. It is all too easy for Christians to share in this spirit with the world. This book, in typical Puritan form, &#39;doctors&#39; the reader by proposing remedies to our spiritual diseases and helps us grow a spirit of thankfulness in its place. The author focuses especially on helping to bring calm and contentment to the hearts of those in sad and discouraged times. He also aims to promote peace and harmony among believers with various differences of opinion.</p><p>Jeremiah Burroughs (1599-1646) was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He then ministered to two congregations in East Anglia before leaving to minister to the English church at Rotterdam in 1637. On his return to England in 1642 he quickly became known as one of the most popular London preachers. Burroughs was one of the delegates to the Westminster Assembly. He and four others objected to the form of church government agreed on by the majority. Peaceable by temperament, he grieved at the divisions which inevitably followed their objections.</p><h2>Pheasant Hunter&#39;s Harvest</h2><p>A celebration of pheasants, pheasant dogs, and pheasant hunting.<br></p><p>Pheasant Hunter's Harvest is a celebration of pheasants, pheasant dogs, and pheasant hunting. It is a remarkably human and textured evocation of the beauty, drama, humor, and excitement of the author's avowed 'grand passion.' Grooms brings to his stories of days afield an infectious enthusiasm for the quarry and for the sport. He captures the full experience of pheasant hunting: the complex strategizing, the joys of working in partnership with a dog, the warmth of hunting friendships polished by years of time shared afield, the occasional moments of pain, the drama, the triumphs and the overall wonder of the sport. (61/4 X 91/4, 196 pages, illustrations)<br>Grooms believes modern agricultural systems have degraded Midwestern farmland and hunting environments. Most of the book, however, is a paean to the ways pheasants and hunting have enriched his life. In Modern Pheasant Hunting (Stackpole, 1982), he pronounced judgment on equipment and tactics; here he offers series of stories illustrating his maturing awareness of quality vs. quantity issues. Like Joel Vance ( Upland Bird Hunting, LJ 6/1/82), he celebrates place and experience with passion, candid self-awareness, and an eye for detail. He seeks the moments when "the land and the bird and the dog form a holy triangle." Any hunter experienced in the glory years of the 1960s will nod knowingly; the later generation may have to settle for envy.

How he and his tiny friend, Sophie, conspire to put an end to the loathsome activities of the other Giants is marvelously told by a writer and an artist who &#34;are uncanny in their understanding of what children like to read and see.&#34;--The New York Times Book Review.</p><p>Evidently not even Roald Dahl could resist the acronym craze of the early eighties. BFG? Bellowing ferret-faced golfer? Backstabbing fairy godmother? Oh, oh ... Big Friendly Giant! This BFG doesn't seem all that F at first as he creeps down a London street, snatches little Sophie out of her bed, and bounds away with her to giant land. And he's not really all that B when compared with his evil, carnivorous brethren, who bully him for being such an oddball runt. After all, he eats only disgusting snozzcumbers, and while the other Gs are snacking on little boys and girls, he's blowing happy dreams in through their windows. What kind of way is that for a G to behave?<p> The BFG is one of Dahl's most lovable character creations. Whether galloping off with Sophie nestled into the soft skin of his ear to capture dreams as though they were exotic butterflies; speaking his delightful, jumbled, squib-fangled patois; or whizzpopping for the Queen, he leaves an indelible impression of bigheartedness. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p><b>Roald Dahl</b>&nbsp;(1916-1990) was born in Wales of Norwegian parents.

George Steiner, in <em>The New Yorker</em>, called it "the best biography of Goethe in English." Doris Lessing, in <em>The Independent</em>, called it "biography at its best." And <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> hailed it as "a remarkable achievement," adding "there is nothing comparable to this study in any language."<br> Now comes the second volume of this definitive portrait, published on the 250th anniversary of Goethe's birth. Here Nicholas Boyle chronicles the most eventful and crowded years of Goethe's life: the period of the French Revolution--which turned Goethe's life upside down--and of the philosophical revolution in Germany which ushered in the periods of Idealism and Romanticism. It was also a period dominated by two intense personal relationships--with Schiller, Weimar's other great poet, philosopher, and dramatist, and with Christiana Vulpius, the mother of his son. Boyle paints vivid portraits of Goethe's harrowing experiences of the Revolutionary wars, of the explosion of new ideas in philosophy and literature which for ten years made Jena the intellectual capital of Europe, and of the upheavals sparked by Napoleon which destroyed the Holy Roman Empire. <br> Boyle captures both the large-scale events that swept Europe and the personal dramas of this exciting time. And he offers brilliant new analyses of Goethe's works of the period, most notably <em>Wilhelm Meister, The Natural Daughter</em>, and <em>Faust</em>. Indeed, this volume is a major work of historical and literary scholarship, and an important biography of one of the giants of Western culture.</p><p>We barely glimpse Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in this magisterial tome's first 75 pages, which are devoted to the revolutions wrought by the French people in politics and Immanuel Kant in philosophy. They must be understood, argues British scholar Nicholas Boyle in the second volume of a projected trilogy, because their impact transformed Goethe's life and art: "What had been a cultural quest, winding through the complex social certainties of the German ancien regime, became an interrogation of all levels of existence in an epoch of world-wide revolution and nascent Romanticism." Examining the period simplistically known as "Weimar classicism" (1790-1803), Boyle offers penetrating analyses of <i>Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship</i>, <i>Faust: Part I</i>, and <i>The Natural Daughter</i>, the works through which Goethe developed his mature theme of renunciation, "the silence that acknowledges the absence from reality of the Ideal." But the author also limns with acuity Goethe's relations with other German intellectuals, in particular his intimate friendship with Friedrich von Schiller, and his less rarified activities, notably the common-law marriage to a woman who rooted him in everyday life. This is not a book for the light-minded or easily daunted reader, but those up to its challenges will revel in a thrilling blend of comprehensive biography and an epic intellectual history. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><br><strong>Nicholas Boyle</strong> is Reader in German Literary and Intellectual History, and Head of the Department of German, at Cambridge University.

Bush</h2><p>In this ambitious work of political narrative, Robert Draper takes us inside the Bush White House and delivers an intimate portrait of a tumultuous decade and a beleaguered administration. Virtually every page of this book crackles with scenes, anecdotes, and dialogue that will surprise even long-time observers of George W. Bush.<br> With unprecedented access to all the key figures of this administration from six one-on-one sessions with the president, to Laura Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleeza Rice, Karl Rove, and perhaps 200 other players, some well-known, some not Draper has achieved what no other journalist or contemporary historian has done thus far: he has told the story of the Bush White House from the inside, with a special emphasis on how the very personality of this strong-willed president has affected the outcome of events.<br> Bush loyalists and the growing number of Bush detractors will all find much to savor in this riveting political page-turner. We begin with a revealing lunch at the White House where a testy, hot dog-chomping president finally unburdens himself to the inquisitive reporter, a fellow Texan who well understands the manly argot that courses through this administration. <br> We revisit the primaries of election-year 2000, in which the character of the candidate and indeed the future of the Republican Party were forged in the scalding South Carolina battle with Senator John McCain. We proceed forward to witness intimately the confusion and the eloquence that followed the September 11 attacks, then the feckless attempts to provide electricity to a darkened Baghdad, the high- and lowlights of the 2004 re-election bid, the startling and fruitless attempt to spend capital by overhauling the Social Security system, the inept response to Katrina, the downward spiraling and increasingly divisive war in Iraq.<br> Though the headlines may be familiar, the details, the utterly inside account of how events transpired will come as fresh reportage to even the most devoted followers of mainstream media coverage. In this most press-wary of administrations, Robert Draper has accomplished a small miracle: He has knocked on all on the right doors, and thus become the first author to tell a personality-driven history of the Bush years. In so doing, he allows us to witness in complete granularity the personal force of a president determined to achieve big things, who remained an optimist in the face of a sometimes harsh unpopularity, who confronted the history of his time with what can surely be described as dead certainty.</p><p>Robert Draper is a contributing writer to the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> and <i>National Geographic</i> and a correspondent to <i>GQ</i>. He is the author of several books, most recently the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. Bush</i>. He lives in Washington D.C.<p><b>PROLOGUE</b></p><p><b>December 12, 2006</b></p><p>"You can't possibly figure out the history of the Bush presidency -- until I'm dead."</p><p>George W. Bush slipped a piece of cheese into his mouth. "Let's order first." He took a quick glance at the day's menu prepared for him and his guest, saw nothing on it he cared for, and announced to the steward, "I'll have a hot dog. Low fat hot dog."</p><p>Then he slapped down the menu and asked, "What is the purpose of this book?"</p><p>He was edgy that day. Earlier that morning, Bush had decided that a major address slotted for next week was going to have to wait another month. The subject was Iraq, and he was, frankly, unsure of what to say on the subject. A bipartisan commission called the Iraq Study Group -- cochaired by longtime Bush family consigliere James A. Baker III -- had recently returned its report, which had labeled that country's condition "grave and deteriorating." Progress in that ongoing conflict had been inchwise even before sectarian violence began to develop its awful momentum in the spring of 2006 and threaten to tear the country apart. Bush had repeatedly said that the war was winnable. He had said that the American-led Coalition was, in fact, winning. No one, including Bush, was claiming imminent victory anymore.</p><p>So, what to say? Bush was a quarterback now playing defense. Five weeks before, the Democrats had seized back the House and the Senate in an election that even Bush had to concede was to some degree a referendum on the tragic misadventures in Iraq. The Democrats, with public backing, were clamoring for a change in course. So was the Iraq Study Group. And so -- with their tongues freshly loosened by the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld -- were the generals in whose trust Bush had placed the mission. Stung by this reality, Bush nonetheless was digging in his heels. The day after the midterms, he had announced his intention to replace Rumsfeld with Robert Gates. Beyond that, Bush would not veer in haste. He would take the holidays to think about it.</p><p>"If you're weak internally? This job will run you all over town," the president observed. He was sitting in the small conference room beside the Oval Office where his predecessor, Bill Clinton, infamously found leisure time with Monica Lewinsky. His back was to the White House lawn. He had flung himself into his chair like a dirty sweatshirt and continued to pop pieces of cheese into his mouth. Stress was hammered into his face. The subject was himself -- how his leadership skills had evolved over time, and how he had dealt with disappointment and defeat, going back to his loss to Senator John McCain in the New Hampshire primary of 2000 and now, once again, in 2006.</p><p>Bush, as always, bridled at the request to navel-gaze. "You're the observer," he said as he worked the cheese in his mouth. "I'm not. I really do not feel comfortable in the role of analyzing myself. I'll <i>try</i>. But I don't spend a lot of time. I will tell you, the primaries strip you down to your bare essence, and you get to determine whether or not you're willing to fight through -- to prevail. It's a real test of will, I agree to that. I think the whole process was responsible for testing my will. <i>No question</i> getting defeated was a powerful moment."</p><p>He added, "I've never run a race where I thought I wouldn't win. I thought we were gonna hold the House and the Senate in '06. I thought we'd lose nine or ten seats, and I thought we'd be one or two up in the Senate."</p><p>Bush had held that view, almost manic in its optimism, all the way up to election day, in defiance of all available polling data. At the very mention of such data, his face began to curdle. "I understand you can't let polls tell you what to think," he declared -- one of his most frequently expressed sentiments, but now he went further: "And part of being a leader is: <i>people watch you</i>. I walk in that hall, I say to those commanders -- well, guess what would happen if I walk in and say, 'Well, maybe it's not worth it.' When I'm out in the public" -- and now he was fully animated, yanked out of his slouch and his eyes clenched like little blue fists -- "I fully understand that the enemy watches me, the Iraqis are watching me, the troops watch me, and the people watch me.</p><p>"The other thing is that <i>you can't fake it</i>. You have to believe it. And I believe it. I believe we'll succeed."</p><p>In spite of his stated preference that he be viewed as a simple guy, Bush now and then would reveal subtle shadings or outright dualities in his character. Here he was, for example, saying that he would not be influenced by polls -- and then, a sentence later, saying that the job <i>required</i> acute consciousness of public perceptions. His father was better known for discretion and attention to appearances, Bush acknowledged. "My dad was one time speaking to the Press Club," he reminisced. "And the last question is always kind of a funny question: 'Why are you wearing a blue tie?' And he kind of balked. I whispered, 'Tell him you spilled gravy on your red one.'</p><p>"Now I don't know how that happened. It popped in my head. I didn't train for the quip. By the way: He said it, and the place went wild. And then -- typical George Bush -- he said, 'Well, my son told me that!' He had to share the credit, instead of taking it and running with it!"</p><p>Interest in the relationship between the 41st and 43rd presidents was unquenchable, for reasons historical, political, and Oedipal. Despite their mutual love and their common experiences -- which included such not-so-trifling matters as invading Iraq and appointing Dick Cheney to positions of high power -- they were two profoundly different men. Above all, George W. had long emphasized, he was his own man. Seldom did he call on his father as a useful executive resource.</p><p>"Yeah, I asked him about it," he said when the subject turned to choosing Cheney as his vice president. "He said, 'You'll like working with him.' My relationship with my dad is, y'know -- I don't call him and say, 'Give me your list of potential candidates, man!' Or, 'What are the five things <i>you</i> would do if you were me?' It's more, 'Y'know, I'm really thinking about Dick Cheney, Dad.' Or, 'I'm thinking about Bob Gates. You've worked with Bob Gates, what's he like?' He knows as an ex-president, he doesn't have nearly the amount of knowledge I've got on current things. I mean, I get briefed every day, twice a day sometimes. He knows that. And plus, once the president gets a strategy in mind -- I mean, there's no need to argue about the Freedom Agenda! I'm sure he subscribes to a lot of it. Now, the rumors are that he and his people don't. But I don't necessarily think it's true. But, look, <i>you can't talk me out of thinking freedom's a good thing</i>!"</p><p>His hot dog arrived. Bush ate rapidly, with a sort of voracious disinterest. He was a man who required comfort and routine. Food, for him, was fuel and familiarity. It was not a thing to reflect on.</p><p>"The job of the president," he continued, through an ample wad of bread and sausage, "is to think strategically so that you can accomplish big objectives. As opposed to playing mini-ball. You can't play miniball with the influence we have and expect there to be peace. You've gotta think, think BIG. The Iranian issue," he said as bread crumbs tumbled out of his mouth and onto his chin, "is <i>the</i> strategic threat right now facing a generation of Americans, because Iran is promoting an extreme form of religion that is competing with <i>another</i> extreme form of religion. Iran's a destabilizing force. And instability in that part of the world has deeply adverse consequences, like energy falling in the hands of extremist people that would use it to blackmail the West. And to couple all of that with a nuclear" -- as always, he pronounced it <i>nu-ku-ler</i> -- "weapon, then you've got a dangerous situation. ...That's what I mean by strategic thought. I don't know how you learn that. I don't think there's a moment where that happened to me. I really don't. I know you're searching for it. I know it's difficult. I do know -- y'know, how do you decide, how do you learn to decide things? When you make up your mind, and you stick by it -- I don't know that there's a moment, Robert. I really -- You either know how to do it or you don't. I think part of this is it: I ran for reasons. Principled reasons. There were principles by which I will stand on. And when I leave this office I'll stand on them. And therefore you can't get driven by polls. Polls aren't driven by principles. They're driven by the moment. By the nanosecond."</p><p>A moment later, press secretary Tony Snow stepped into the doorway and immediately assumed a deferential tone. "When I go in front of the press," he said, referring to the daily briefing he was about to conduct, "can I just say, 'We will not be giving the speech until the New Year'? I mean -- "</p><p>"The New Year," Bush cut in, "and the reason why is, the president still has other people to listen to, and there's a lot of work to be done on a very important task. And I think you oughta just say, 'He's gonna be very deliberate -- and listen, he's not gonna be rushed.' "</p><p>"Yeah," said Snow.</p><p>"And if their argument is, 'Well, what happens if there's an attack in Baghdad?' You can say, 'He talked to his commanders today, and there's a <i>current</i> strategy in place.' "</p><p>"Right."</p><p>"Of dealing, protecting -- whatever."</p><p>"Can we say you're moving in a direction and assigning tasks to people to try and work out -- there are hard political issues -- "</p><p>"Yeah." Bush's voice rose, as if facing the truculent press at that very moment: "I want to make sure before we put the policy in place that Gates -- <i>I don't have a secretary of defense</i>!"</p><p>"Right, I'm working that out -- "</p><p>" 'The president wants to make sure that all the key players on the national security team are well briefed, well versed, and ready to make a measured judgment,' " Bush finished.</p><p>"Good. Perfect. Sorry to interrupt," Snow said as he vacated the room.</p><p>"It's okay," remarked Bush.

Spontaneous sketches and a travelogue diary document his adventures and quiet moments, creating a raw and intimate portrait of countries, culture and the wandering artist.</li></ul></p><p><b>Craig Thompson</b> is a cartoonist and the author of the award-winning books <i>Blankets</i>; <i>Good-bye, Chunky Rice</i>; and <i>Habibi</i>. He was born in Michigan in 1975, and grew up in a rural farming community in central Wisconsin. His graphic novel <i>Blankets</i> won numerous industry awards and has been published in nearly twenty languages. Thompson lives in Portland, Oregon.Adult/High School&#x2013;In 2004, the author, a cartoonist from Oregon, traveled to Europe on a book-signing tour, with a side trip to Morocco. Rather than writing a conventional journal, he kept notes in the form of drawings and cartoons. He shows readers how he was met in France by friends, fans, and publisher representatives, and tells of larking about&#x2013;finding magic, meaning, and synchronicity&#x2013;in Paris and the countryside. When he moved on to Morocco, his experience was darker as he struggled to relate to a more alien and less-welcoming culture. There he encountered everything from homesickness to diarrhea to fractured conversations, but in time he saw more of the country and learned how to get around. Back in Europe, he continued his book tour in Geneva and Barcelona, and saw the Alps and the south of France. Along with images of people and places, he shares, with winningly self-deprecating humor, his interior journey of emotional ups and downs. Black-and-white images range in style from realistic sketches to surrealistic riffs to funny cartoons, sometimes working together visually and thematically to create layers of depth and to amplify a point. Combined with telegraphic captions, the art captures to perfection and with a great sense of immediacy what it's like to be young and on one's own on a foreign adventure. By turns lighthearted and profound, <i>Carnet</i> is an illuminating and charming experience that should have broad appeal.<i>&#x2013;Christine C.

Durante got his nose from his mother, who bore him on a kitchen table in Brooklyn (`` `Holy Smokes!' yells da neighbor lady whose deliverin' me. 'Dis ain't da baby, it's da stork!' ''). He early showed a mastery of the piano (``My father thought I'd become a concert piano player like that Russian guy, Sir Rockinoff'') but was diverted from the classics to playing ragtime and jazz in Coney Island bawdy houses. Soon, Durante married Jeanne Olson, a singer, who guided him into better jobs. His career spanned nightclubs and speak-easies, Broadway, Hollywood, radio, records, and TV, and included two comebacks. His early films are forgettable turkeys, his successes Jumbo and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. In nightclubs Durante began telling more and more jokes to establish that he was the leader of the band, yelling, ``Stop the music!'' and erupting with a comical outburst. But the greater his successes, the more his wife drank, feeling alienated from Durante, who attracted the Broadway greats. After 22 years of marriage, Jeanne died of a heart ailment and alcoholism. Remarrying at age 67, Durante and his second bride, 39, adopted a girl. Later, after a stroke felled the actor, his friends attested that there was something in him that brought out the best in them. Durante died at age 86. Swift but moving, light but not thin. (Photographs.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Veteran journalist and biographer Robbins ( Yul Brynner ) recalls the life of the late comic, the small man with the big nose known to his fans as Schnozzola. Born in 1894 to French-Italian parents, Durante grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side and quit school early. He began playing piano in tough clubs and telling jokes, even though he was "afraid people would laugh at me." But audiences only laughed with Durante as he assaulted the English language and warbled the dizzy songs that made him a star on Broadway, radio, movies and TV. The author attributes the entertainer's worldwide popularity not only to his singular talents but to his kindness, generosity and courtesy (an assessment backed up by the affectionate reminiscences of Frank Sinatra, George Burns, Marlene Dietrich, Ethel Merman, Bette Davis and a host of other admirers). Numerous anecdotes portray the Schnoz as a man without an enemy, a rare phenomenon in showbiz. Photos.

For missing it. For succumbing to the danger and idolatry of forcing God into preconceived ideals. What if there were a better way? What if Jesus came not to help people escape the world but rather to restore it? Best-selling author and spoken word artist Jefferson Bethke says that &#x201c;Christians have the greatest story ever told but we aren&#x2019;t telling it.&#x201d; So in this new book, Bethke tells that story anew, presenting God&#x2019;s truths from the Old and the New Testaments as the challenging and compelling story that it is&#x2014;a grand narrative with God at the center.

His satirical illustrations form a portrait of America between 1900 and 1940. Flagg&#39;s best-known work was the WWI &#34;Uncle Sam Wants You&#34; recruiting poster. It is the most famous American poster in history. Flagg&#39;s prowess as an artist was staggering; he worked in any medium with equal ease - pen and ink, watercolor, oils, charcoal, and pencil, and was even an expert sculptor. The Flagg girl, a saucy, full-lipped long-legged woman created by the artist, illustrated the same canons of beauty that prevail today, and Flagg&#39;s widely circulated portrait drawings and paintings of celebrities form a composite of the prominent literary, artistic, theatrical, and political figures of the first half of the 290trh century. Besides being the country&#39;s most famous illustrator, Flagg was also its most conspicuous bohemian, an incorrigible individualist who always made the headline with his escapades around New York. Flagg was also a poet, author, satirist, motion-picture writer, and actor. He wrote and illustrated 12 books; wrote and acted in 24 silent films; and wrote and acted in countless playlets. JAMES MONTGOMERY FLAGG recreates in book form, for the first time, the excitement and humor of Flagg&#39;s America. Here is the story of the man - from the time he sold his first illustration at the age of 12 to his last phase as a Hollywood illustrator. The book is lavishly illustrated with Flagg&#39;s posters, his pen and inks, magazine covers, charcoal portraits of celebrities and his skilled easel paintings, portraits, and landscapes in oil and watercolor. 208 pages. 175 black and while illustrations. 70 full color plates.

Later he became a writer at <i>Late Night with Conan O'Brien </i>and then a regular performer on <i>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</i>. In 2003, Demetri won the Perrier Award at the International Fringe Festival for his first one-man show, <i>If I</i>. He released a comedy album called <i>These Are Jokes </i>and then created and starred in his own television series called <i>Important Things with Demetri Martin</i>. His first stand-up comedy special, <i>Demetri Martin. Person</i> is considered by many to be his longest and only hour-long stand-up comedy special. Martin has appeared in movies as an actor, most recently in Steven Soderbergh's <i>Contagion</i> and most lengthily in Ang Lee's <i>Taking Woodstock</i>.

I know that sounds like a childish criticism, but I mean it literally: This book is so funny, I forgot a whole bunch of things--who I am, what I stand for, large chunks of my childhood, my sense of equilibrium, how to fall asleep, and when I'm supposed to laugh at things."<strong>-Chuck Klosterman</strong><br><br>"Demetri Martin has a very funny and original mind.

Traveling across the prairies, over the Rockies, and on to the Pacific, Thompson transformed the raw data of his explorations into a map of the Canadian West. Measuring ten feet by seven feet and exhibiting astonishing accuracy, the map became essential to the politicians and diplomats who would decide the future of the rich and promising lands of the West. Yet its creator worked without personal glory and died in penniless obscurity.<br>Drawing extensively on Thompson&#x2019;s personal journals and illustrated with his detailed sketches, intricate notebook pages, and the map itself, <i>Epic Wanderer</i> charts the life of a man who risked everything in the name of scientific advancement and exploration.</p><p>D&#x2019;Arcy Jenish is the author of <i>Indian Fall: The Last Great Days of the Plains Cree</i> <i>and the Blackfoot Confederacy</i> and the best-selling <i>The Stanley Cup: One Hundred Years of Hockey at Its Best</i>."Well illustrated and served well by a thorough bibliography, this imaginative reconstruction will whet readers' appetites to seek out the copious literature on Thompson, the 'epic wanderer.'"&#x2014;<i>Choice</i> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Now and again a book comes along that simply transcends geographical limits. <i>Epic Wanderer</i> is such a book. . . . <i>Epic Wanderer</i>, like the man himself, covers a lot of ground and does so very well.

What lies behind your thoughts about almost everything? For more than thirty years, James W. Sire has grappled with this issue. In this book he offers readers his most mature thought on the concept of a worldview, addressing such questions as <ul><li>What is the history of the concept itself?</li><li>What is the first question you should ask in formulating a worldview?</li><li>How are worldviews formed existentially as well as intellectually?</li><li>Is a worldview primarily an intellectual system, a way of life or a story?</li><li>What are the public and private dimensions of a worldview?</li><li>What role can worldview thinking play in assessing your own worldview and those of others, especially in light of the pluralism in today's world?</li></ul> In his widely used textbook <em>The Universe Next Door,</em> first published in 1976, Sire offered a succinct definition of a worldview and catalogued in summary fashion seven basic worldview alternatives. Students, critics, new literature and continued reflection have led him to reexamine and refine his definition of a worldview. This companion volume to <em>The Universe Next Door</em> is the fruit of that effort. Here is an excellent resource for exploring more deeply how and why worldview thinking can aid you in navigating your pluralistic universe.</p><p>James W. Sire (PhD, University of Missouri), formerly a senior editor at InterVarsity Press, is an active speaker and writer. He has taught English, philosophy, theology, and short courses at many universities and seminaries. He continues to be a frequent guest lecturer in the United States and Europe. His InterVarsity Press books and Bible studies include <em>The Universe Next Door</em> (a worldviews textbook), <em>Scripture Twisting, Discipleship of the Mind, Chris Chrisman Goes to College, Why Should Anyone Believe Anything at All?, Habits of the Mind: Intellectual Life as a Christian Calling, Naming the Elephant: Worldview as a Concept, Learning to Pray Through the Psalms, Why Good Arguments Often Fail </em> and <em>A Little Primer on Humble Apologetics.</em>Sire, who as an InterVarsity Press editor and author of <i>The Universe Next Door</i> helped introduce Christian college students to "worldview," revisits the subject with a more technical approach that sacrifices the essential simplicity of the earlier work. The title refers to the story of a father asked to explain what holds up the world. Eventually he chooses "the biggest animal he could think of and put a capital on it... 'It's an Elephant... it's Elephant all the way down.' " Like the Elephant, a worldview is expected to answer big questions about "the basic makeup of our world," and is likely "brought to mind only when we are challenged by a foreigner from another ideological universe." Sire notes that such challenges are mounting in our increasingly pluralistic world, even though the basic menu of worldview options remains mostly unchanged from a generation ago, with the (grudgingly acknowledged) addition of postmodernism. In defining the concept of worldview, Sire goes beyond his earlier treatment of worldviews as "answers to a systematic set of questions" to consider other possibilities. A worldview can also take the form of a story, a way of life, a pre-theoretical intuition or a pattern of actions. Such alternatives promote a nuanced appreciation of worldviews, and of the serious difficulty in communicating across worldview frontiers. But for all these refinements, Sire's message remains basically the same: Christians tend to have Christian beliefs, and others tend not to. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The almost simultaneous victory of the Heavy Brigade has, therefore, been overshadowed by this event. This book describes the organization, tactical doctrine and exact strength of the British Cavalry in the Crimea, and the events of 25th October 1854. The main chapters are devoted to descriptions of the exact appearance of the officers, NCOs and troopers of the regiments who rode in the two great charges of that day. Drawing upon dress regulations and the evidence of rare early photographs, and upon examination of surviving uniforms and equipment, this book attempts to recreate the finery of the regiment: the Dragoon Guards, the Dragoons, the Light Dragoons, the Hussars and the Lancers.

Parts of the map were unfilled--chief among those spaces was the North Pole, which many believed contained warm currents that might provide safe passage. Enter James Gordon Bennett, the wealthy and eccentric owner of the <em>New York Herald</em>. Bennett--who was responsible for sending Stanley in search of Livingstone--wanted to produce another thrill for his readers, so he funded a naval expedition to reach the pole. Captained by George Washington De Long, the <em>U.S.S. Jeannette</em> shipped out in 1879 toward glory and parts unknown. The <em>Jeannette</em> became encased in ice, but the adventure was only just beginning. Author Hampton Sides does a masterful job of setting up the voyage against the backdrop of the Gilded Age, developing fascinating characters along the way, and delivering a true triumph of narrative nonfiction. Drawing on journal entries, letters, and eventually his own visit to the region, Sides paints a vivid, moving, and breathless portrait of the crew of the <em>Jeannette</em>.

So imagine the child's shock when she<b>'</b>s forced to move in with the dreaded country kin. They keep pets in the house! They eat in the kitchen&nbsp;and expect her to walk to school by herself! But little by little, as she helps with the chores around the farm and makes new friends, sickly, self-centered Elizabeth Ann is transformed into confident, independent Betsy.<br> Generations of readers have delighted in Betsy<b>'</b>s adventures since the book<b>'</b>s original publication in 1917. Author Dorothy Canfield Fisher introduced Americans to the Montessori Method, an educational approach that<b>'</b>s reflected in her tale of childhood freedom and self-sufficiency. <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> praised <i>Understood Betsy</i> for being "as satisfying in its evocation of an earlier, simpler way of life as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House books, and psychologically more acute."</p><p>Dorothy Canfield Fisher (1879&#x2013;1958) wrote more than 20 novels and 18 works of nonfiction.

Her quiet act of defiance is often considered the beginning of the modern civil rights movement, but historian Douglas Brinkley reminds us that it was neither the beginning nor the end of Rosa Parks's quest for justice. On that fateful day in 1955 she was already a veteran civil rights activist, married to a charter member of the NAACP's Montgomery chapter, and a devout member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the many black churches whose congregants organized and fought to desegregate the South. Brinkley gives a thorough account of Parks's political life in the South and in Detroit (where she moved in 1957 to escape death threats), capturing her majestic personal dignity. Yet he also places her activism within a vivid historical context, anchored by extensive interviews with her peers and Parks herself as well as scholarly research. His subject is now a frail octogenarian, but Brinkley conveys the power of her legacy in a moving final scene when Nelson Mandela, just four months out of a South African jail in 1990, embraces Parks as a comrade and a beloved mentor. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>5 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Beginning of Better Days: Divine Instruction to Women from the Prophet Joseph Smith</h2><p>How important are women in the restored church of Jesus Christ? We learn something about the answer to the question from a simple historic fact: In 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith took time to attend several meetings of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo and give personal instruction to the women there. He did this at a time of great personal turmoil, when persecutions were raging and his responsibilities were heavy. He did it at a time when society barely acknowledged women as having any kind of status at all. On six separate occasions, he taught the women personally about their privileges, their opportunities, their obligations, and the blessings the Lord had in store for them in His kingdom. The Beginning of Better Days includes Joseph Smiths six timeless sermons to the women of Nauvoo, along with personal essays from Sheri Dew and Virginia H. Pearce that help us better understand the sermons and their relevance for Latter-day Saint women today. The authors have attempted to share a little about their own processes of discovery regarding the sermons and say that is what worked for them. What works for you may be similar or it may be completely different. The important thing is to dig in.</p><p>Sheri Dew is a native of Ulysses, Kansas, and a graduate of Brigham Young University. She has authored several books, including the biographies of two presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Presidents Gordon B. Hinckley and Ezra Taft Benson.

While Read (On the Third Day, 1991, etc.) never says as much, his detailed, human-scale account could serve as an allegory for the concurrent chain reaction that resulted in the USSR's meltdown. Drawing on previously classified data and on testimony from participating principals, Read recalls Moscow's post-WW II drive to showcase Communist physics through a network of nuclear generating stations. Moving on to the construction of the Chernobyl complex, he documents how material shortages, technical incompetence, bureaucratic snafus, Communist Party interference, and allied constraints ensured the facility's eventual failure. Although operator errors contributed to the accident, Read leaves little doubt that design deficiencies were primarily responsible. Moreover, he reports, after the explosion, the immediate instinct of most apparatchiks was to cover up the fact that the country and its vaunted scientific establishment were neither ready, willing, nor able to respond effectively to a nuclear emergency: Since Soviet reactors were deemed perfectly safe, for example, no evacuation plans had been drawn up. The official death toll was put at 31, while scapegoats were quickly identified and imprisoned. By contrast, Read cites estimates that Chernobyl ulimately could claim more lives than the Soviets lost in WW II, and he notes that fallout has made large areas of Belorussia, Russia, and the Ukraine uninhabitable, perhaps for thousands of years. Partisans on both sides of the nuclear/environmental issue may take exception to the author's agenda-free narrative: Read allows the story and his sources to speak for themselves, eschewing any hint as to whether he believes atomic power to be a blessing or a bane. A top-notch take on a man-made catastrophe and its chilling consequences. (For a look at Chernobyl's aftermath by the plant's former chief engineer, see Grigori Medvedev's No Breathing Room, p. 207.) (Sixteen pages of photos, three maps--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Read's taut, riveting probe of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion and its aftermath reveals the full magnitude of the disaster as perhaps no other book has done. The English journalist ( Alive ) spent months in Russia, Byelorussia and Ukraine in 1991 interviewing scores of survivors, officials and scientists. Focusing on the human side of the catastrophe, he gives a blow-by-blow account of the accident, complete with reconstructed dialogue, then explores the Soviet cover-up and Western experts' efforts to estimate the effects of a disaster that may ultimately claim more victims than WW II, suggests Read. Instead of acknowledging reactor design flaws and poor safeguards, Soviet officials brought scapegoats to trial, in what Read likens to Stalin's show trials. Drawing on interviews and on newly declassified Soviet medical records, he assesses the plight of residents in the far-flung contaminated zone and discloses that most of the 600,000 cleanup and rescue personnel suffered severe damage to their immune systems.

The FitzWarins dream of returning to their family home - Whittington, taken from them during a war - and of being Lords of the White Castle once more. But John is vindictive and his delight in denying what is rightfully theirs results in Fulke renouncing his allegiance and turning outlaw. The passion of Fulke's life is the young, spirited Maude le Vavasour, for whom her father accepts another offer of marriage. Fulke can offer nothing but a life on the run...</p><p>Elizabeth Chadwick lives in Nottingham with her husband and two sons.

The tourneys feature knights in full regalia honing their fighting skills and competing for prize money, while in the skirmishes grim antagonists defending family fiefs suffer grievous wounds or die with their mounts. Quintessential hero Fulke of the FitzWarin clan is being tutored at court and serves petulant young Prince John as squire. In strong, stalwart Fulke at 15 the eldest of six sons rests the family hope of regaining Whittington castle, the seat of dispossessed forebears. But a confrontation over a chess game renders Fulke and John sworn enemies. When John eventually takes the throne, he punishes his recalcitrant former squire by denying his claim to the property and awarding it to the rogue occupant, whereupon Fulke becomes an outlaw with a price upon his head. Meanwhile, 12-year-old tomboy Maude le Vavasour is offered in marriage by her father to any noble prepared to pay a fee; Lord Walter, a bachelor in his 40s, pities the child and marries her. Subsequently widowed, she becomes Fulke's bride, a tempestuous, passionate woman with skill as an archer that saves her husband's life. The novel is based on fact, with Chadwick's period scholarship and vivid imagination thoroughly fleshing out the meager historical record. The end result is a lively, well-plotted drama, superior to the norm. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Home That Was Our Country: A Memoir of Syria</h2><p>At the Arab Spring's hopeful start, Alia Malek returned to Damascus to reclaim her grandmother's apartment, which had been lost to her family since Hafez al-Assad came to power in 1970. Its loss was central to her parent's decision to make their lives in America. In chronicling the people who lived in the Tahaan building, past and present, Alia portrays the Syrians-the Muslims, Christians, Jews, Armenians, and Kurds-who worked, loved, and suffered in close quarters, mirroring the political shifts in their country. Restoring her family's home as the country comes apart, she learns how to speak the coded language of oppression that exists in a dictatorship, while privately confronting her own fears about Syria's future.<br><br><i>The Home That Was Our Country </i>is a deeply researched, personal journey that shines a delicate but piercing light on Syrian history, society, and politics.

It offers not easy answers, but the "rougher edges of truth" that allow for a more profoundly humanistic portrait of the region and the causes of the current unrest. I missed home as I read: the hospitality and customs and cuisine; the diverse inhabitants that make up the rich tapestry of the old cities and villages; the women, of all socioeconomic backgrounds, who form the backbone of family life-the way it once was."&#x2015;<b>Micheline Aharonian Marcom, author of THREE APPLES FELL FROM HEAVEN</b><br><br>"Alia Malek takes us on a journey through time as she travels from her birthplace of Baltimore to the country from which her family hails, Syria.

She finds the meaning of what it is to be Syrian through the diverse characters that lived in her grandmother's building in Damascus. But as Malek restores her grandmother's home she watches her country fall apart with the Syrian conflict unfolding in the background. She tells the story of violence engulfing Syria as a brutal war shatters the mosaic of ethnicities and faiths that make up the Syria she'd always known. A beautiful, nuanced and human memoir that weaves the tale of Syria's history through Malek's own family and leaves the reader with the vivid sense of loss, alienation and fear likely common to all Syrians trapped in this conflict."&#x2015;<b>Leila Fadel, Middle East Correspondent, NPR</b><br><br> "Moving and insightful, Malek's memoir combines sharp-eyed observations of Syrian politics, only occasionally overdone, with elegiac commentary on home, exile, and a bygone era.

They took three billion man-hours to build. And even though most are crumbling today, they contain a magnificent scientific and cultural story&#x2015;about the geothermal forces that formed their stones, the tectonic movements that brought them to the surface, the glacial tide that broke them apart, the earth that held them for so long, and about the humans who built them.</p><p>Stone walls tell nothing less than the story of how New England was formed, and in Robert Thorson's hands they live and breathe. "The stone wall is the key that links the natural history and human history of New England," Thorson writes. Millions of years ago, New England's stones belonged to ancient mountains thrust up by prehistoric collisions between continents. During the Ice Age, pieces were cleaved off by glaciers and deposited&#x2015;often hundreds of miles away&#x2015;when the glaciers melted. Buried again over centuries by forest and soil buildup, the stones gradually worked their way back to the surface, only to become impediments to the farmers cultivating the land in the eighteenth century, who piled them into "linear landfills," a place to hold the stones. Usually the biggest investment on a farm, often exceeding that of the land and buildings combined, stone walls became a defining element of the Northeast's landscape, and a symbol of the shift to an agricultural economy. </p><p>Stone walls layer time like Russian dolls, their smallest elements reflecting the longest spans, and Thorson urges us to study them, for each stone has its own story. Linking geological history to the early American experience, <i>Stone by Stone</i> presents a fascinating picture of the land the Pilgrims settled, allowing us to see and understand it with new eyes.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert M. Thorson</b> -- scientist, teacher, writer -- is Professor of Geology at the University of Connecticut, where he holds a joint appointment between the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) and the Department of Anthropology, with additional resonsibilities to the Honors Program and the Integrated Geosciences Program. He teaches courses, advises students, performs sponsored research, serves on committees, and provides articles, reviews and interviews. Beyond the classroom, he writes a weekly Thursday column for <i>The Hartford Courant</i>, and coordinates the Stone Wall Initiative, now in the processs of being incorported into Connecticut State Museum of Natural History (Connecticut Archaeology Center). He is a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Geophysical Union, The Geological Society of America, and the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Science.</p>"To know New England well, one must know its stone walls," writes the author of this authoritative paean to the structures he calls the "signatures of rural New England." There were once approximately 240,000 miles of stone walls in New England, and Thorson, a professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Connecticut, combines natural history and human history as he tells the story of the walls and how they were built. In his geo-archeological study, he begins by exploring how the stones, formed deep within the earth, were shaped and scattered by glaciation, buried under forest and soil buildup, brought to the surface after the New England pioneers cut down the trees and exposed the soil to frost heave, and tossed to the sides of their fields by early farmers clearing the land. He finds these tossed walls, which make up the majority of stone walls in New England, as aesthetically pleasing as the carefully constructed walls that came later. Every type of stone wall fascinates him. He extols their color, form and texture, the sounds they make, the shelter they provide for animals, their beauty as they disintegrate. As agriculture declined in the region, the walls were neglected, and today they are "almost as sad as they are simple," he says, for they are evidence of a lost Yankee culture. Now most of the walls have been abandoned, and their stones have become a cash crop to be sold and often carried far away from their original locations, which Thorson considers an "environmental tragedy." His book covers much technical material, but his enthusiasm for the subject brings it to life. Copious notes, extensive bibliography and an appendix with geologic time lines are included.

He lives in Wyoming.ONE-CAR BRIDGE<br><br>�<br><br>The tires of Joe Pickett&#x2019;s green Ford Wyoming Game<br>and Fish Department pickup thumped rhythmically<br>across the one-car bridge that spanned the Twelve<br>Sleep River. Ahead was the Crazy Z Bar Ranch. Joe was there<br>to deliver bad news to the ranch manager.<br><br>It was Saturday in early September during the two-week period<br>between the end of summer in the high country and preceding<br>hunting season openers. The morning had started off<br>with the bite of fall but had warmed by the hour. The groves of<br>aspens in the mountains were already turning gold, although<br>the cottonwoods flanking both sides of the river still held green<br>and full. The river was down but still floatable, and upriver in<br>the distance he caught a glimpse of a low-profile McKenzie-style<br>drift boat rounding a bend. The guide manned the oars, and<br>fly-fishermen clients cast from the front and back of the boat,<br>long sweeps of fly-line catching the sun, toward a deep seam<br>near the far bank.<br><br>He held his breath as he did every time he drove across. There<br>were gaps between the two-by-eights that made up the surface<br>of the bridge and he could see glimpses of the river flash by<br>through his open driver&#x2019;s-side window. The bridge itself was<br>over forty-five years old and constructed of steel girders held<br>together by bolts. Auburn tears of rust flowed down the surface<br>of the steel and pooled in the channels of the I-beams, which<br>had long ago inspired a local fishing guide to deem it &#x201c;the<br>Bridge of Cries.&#x201d; It stuck.<br><br>Out of view beneath the bridge hung a large metal hand-<br>painted sign:<br>THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY<br>FISHERMEN, STAY IN YOUR BOAT<br>VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED<br>BY THE CRAZY Z BAR RANCH<br>Joe knew from experience they weren&#x2019;t kidding. Even that<br>time in high water when a raft filled with Boy Scouts capsized<br>on the swells and rocks. Eight sodden but uninjured Scouts and<br>their two Scoutmasters&#x2014;one with a broken arm&#x2014;had found<br>the ranch headquarters at dusk. The former manager, following<br>standing orders from the owner, loaded them all into the bed of<br>his three-quarter-ton pickup and drove them to the Saddlestring<br>jail to press charges.<br><br>The absentee owner of the ranch, Lamar Dietrich of St.<br>Louis, had the signs put up when he bought the ranch. He<br>meant what he said and played for keeps. And he wouldn&#x2019;t be<br>happy at all, Joe knew, to hear why Joe had come.<br><br>Daisy, Joe&#x2019;s two-year-old Labrador, raised her head from<br>where she slept on the passenger seat to stare at the Angus cattle<br>that grazed on the side of the dirt road. She was fascinated with<br>cows, and Joe wondered if in Daisy&#x2019;s mind cows appeared to her<br>as very large black dogs. A tremulous whine came from deep in<br>her throat.<br><br>&#x201c;Settle down,&#x201d; Joe said, navigating a turn and plunging his<br>truck through a thin spring creek that crossed the road. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t<br>even think about chasing them.&#x201d;<br><br>Daisy looked over at him with a puzzled expression.<br><br>&#x201c;Chasing Dietrich&#x2019;s cattle is a death sentence. He&#x2019;s had dogs<br>shot for it. I want to keep you around for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>Daisy lowered her head.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got a big binder he calls The Book of Rules that sits on a<br>table in the foreman&#x2019;s house,&#x201d; Joe said to Daisy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen it, and<br>it&#x2019;s thick. He expects every one of his ranch managers to memorize<br>it, and he has tabs for every conceivable circumstance and<br>how they&#x2019;re supposed to deal with it. He&#x2019;s got tabs on trespassing<br>and road improvement and cattle management and fifty or<br>so other tabs on everything he can think of. If the ranch manager<br>makes a decision that isn&#x2019;t covered in The Book of Rules,<br>that manager doesn&#x2019;t stay around very long. There&#x2019;s a tab on<br>stray dogs. They&#x2019;re to be shot on sight so they don&#x2019;t run his<br>cattle.<br><br>&#x201c;So keep your head down, especially if Dietrich is around,&#x201d;<br>Joe said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just plain mean.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe had met Dietrich two times over the years, and both<br>encounters were unpleasant. The old man was in his late seventies<br>and appeared shorter than he actually was because his back<br>was stooped and his shoulders slumped forward. Because of the<br>deformity, his head was always down and when he looked up<br>his eyes appeared menacing. His voice was a low soft growl and<br>he didn&#x2019;t waste words. He had no time or respect for local officials,<br>state game wardens, or incompetent ranch foremen.<br><br>Joe had heard that Dietrich had amassed his fortune by<br>negotiating cutthroat deals with urban governments for waste<br>management services. There were thousands of distinctive red-<br>and-yellow Dietrich Waste Management trucks throughout the<br>inner cities of the Rust Belt and the northeastern states. He&#x2019;d<br>taken on local political machines and organized crime families<br>to secure long-term contracts. Then, like so many extremely<br>wealthy men in America, he had looked around for a safe haven<br>for his cash and opted to sink some of it in real estate and had<br>chosen to buy massive ranches in the West, including this one<br>in Wyoming. The Crazy Z Bar, with tens of thousands of acres<br>of mountainous terrain, pastureland, sagebrush flats, and fifteen<br>premium miles of the Twelve Sleep River snaking through<br>it. The purchase price, Joe had heard, was $22.5 million.<br><br>The first time Joe met Dietrich was when the then-foreman<br>of the ranch, under orders from the owner, had strung bar bed<br>wire across the river to stop the passage of local fishing<br>guides and recreational floaters. Joe had explained that state law<br>allowed access to all navigable waters, that the land itself was<br>private&#x2014;even the river bottom itself&#x2014;but the water was public.<br>As long as the boaters didn&#x2019;t anchor or step out of their boat,<br>they could legally cross the ranch. Dietrich exploded and ordered<br>his then-foreman to beat up Joe right there and then. The<br>foreman refused, and was fired. Joe filed charges against Dietrich<br>for threatening him, but dropped them when Dietrich<br>agreed to remove his barbed-wire fence.<br><br>The second time, just two months ago, Joe was at a hearing<br>before the Game and Fish Commission on a plan Dietrich proposed<br>to convert two thousand acres of his ranch into a wild<br>game hunting operation. Dietrich&#x2019;s idea was to import water<br>buffalo, gazelles, kudu, blackbuck, and scimitar-horned oryx<br>from Africa to be hunted by his friends. Since Joe was the local<br>game warden, he was asked to testify, and he testified against<br>the plan. Exotic, non-native species were a threat to the antelope,<br>deer, and elk populations, he had said, and there was no<br>way for Dietrich to guarantee the animals would never escape or<br>pass along diseases that could decimate local wildlife. Dietrich<br>appeared briefly at the hearing and extended a crooked finger at<br>Joe and called him &#x201c;a no-account tinhorn jackbooted thug.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been called that before.&#x201d;<br><br>Because the atmosphere in the hearing room was so poisonous,<br>the commission chose to take the decision under advisement<br>and issue a ruling at a future date.<br><br>That date had arrived. They had voted no. And Joe was<br>tasked with delivering the verdict to the new ranch manager of<br>the Crazy Z Bar, the Dietrich employee who had drafted and<br>presented the proposal, Kyle Sandford.<br><br>Poor Kyle, Joe thought.<br><br>Although Lamar Dietrich&#x2019;s magnificent empty home&#x2014;<br>built of native stone and sheets of glass so heavy and large that<br>they&#x2019;d been delivered by a cargo helicopter&#x2014;was set into the<br>side of the mountain that overlooked the river bottom, the manager&#x2019;s<br>house was humble and in need of paint and new shingles.<br>It was located on a sagebrush shelf with a cluster of outbuildings<br>including a metal barn, corrals, and a Quonset hut for housing<br>vehicles and machinery.<br><br>There was never any need to knock on the doors of ranch<br>homes, and no way to sneak onto a ranch. Daisy perked up<br>again when a gaggle of motley ranch dogs boiled out from pools<br>of shade and streaked toward Joe&#x2019;s pickup. They formed yipping,<br>tumbling knots on both sides and accompanied him as he<br>drove into the ranch yard, nipping at the tires and fenders, the<br>cacophony signaling the arrival of a stranger.<br><br>&#x201c;You stay,&#x201d; Joe said to Daisy over the racket.<br><br>The three members of the Sandford family appeared from<br>three different places in the ranch yard as if joining each other<br>on a stage: Joleen came from the ranch house itself, drying her<br>hands on a dish towel; Kyle Sr. looked out from the Quonset,<br>gripping a Crescent wrench with an oily hand; and Kyle Jr.<br>strolled from a pocket of willows that marked the bank of the<br>river, his fly rod poking nine feet into the air.<br><br>Joe was most familiar with Kyle Jr., who was seventeen and<br>ran in the same circle as his ward, April. He was a quiet ranch<br>kid who had boarded the same bus as other ranch kids until<br>he could drive himself, but hadn&#x2019;t been in the valley long<br>enough&#x2014;and wasn&#x2019;t an outstanding athlete, scholar, or leader&#x2014;<br>to belong firmly to a pack. He seemed like a floater, the kind of<br>boy who hung back and to the side, keeping his mouth shut,<br>occasionally surprising others with a good quip or an observation,<br>but was never missed when he didn&#x2019;t show up and never<br>mentioned when groups were forming to attend games, go out<br>on Friday nights, or plan a party. Joe recalled April reviewing<br>digital photos of her friends at a football game, pointing out<br>characters and laughing about things they&#x2019;d done or said. When<br>she came across a photo of Kyle Sandford Jr., she shook her head<br>and said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember him being there, but I guess he was.&#x201d;<br><br>Kyle Jr. was wiry and dark with a prominent Adam&#x2019;s apple<br>and wispy sideburns. Joe had never seen the boy smile, but he<br>had eyes that seemed to carefully take everything in.<br><br>Kyle Sr. nodded a reserved hello to Joe and Joe nodded back.<br>Joleen withdrew into the house but stood behind the screen,<br>watching carefully. Kyle Sr. tossed his wrench into a bucket of<br>tools behind him, clamped on a dirty short-brimmed Stetson<br>Rancher, and greeted Joe by saying, &#x201c;Joe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Kyle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you bring me some good news?&#x201d;<br><br>Joe paused. &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br><br>Kyle Sr. took a deep breath and stood still. His face betrayed<br>nothing, but Joe saw Joleen shake her head behind the screen<br>and turn away.<br><br>&#x201c;It was unanimous,&#x201d; Joe said. &#x201c;The commission voted to not<br>allow a game farm. They said it would be a bad precedent, even<br>if your owner did all the security fencing and inoculations he<br>said he would.&#x201d;<br><br>Kyle Sr. said nothing. He just stared at Joe and his mouth got<br>tight.<br><br>Finally, in a thin voice, he said, &#x201c;Is there anything we can do<br>about this?&#x201d;<br><br>Joe was puzzled. Was Kyle Sr. offering a bribe?<br><br>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make another run at &#x2019;em, maybe. Adjust the proposal so<br>they&#x2019;re happy about it this time, you know?&#x201d;<br><br>Joe shook his head. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll meet again in a month, but I<br>can&#x2019;t see them changing their minds.&#x201d;<br><br>Kyle Sr. dropped his head and stared at the top of his boots.<br>&#x201c;You know what&#x2019;s going to happen then, right?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing Lamar Dietrich won&#x2019;t be too happy,&#x201d; Joe said.<br><br>Kyle Sr. snorted and said, &#x201c;You got that right. But you know<br>what else will happen?&#x201d;<br><br>Joe said he didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;Come with me,&#x201d; Kyle Sr. said, gesturing with his chin toward<br>the house. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you something.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe started forward and remembered Kyle Jr. He looked over<br>at the boy as he passed by. &#x201c;Any luck?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re hitting on prince nymphs and scuds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Any size to &#x2019;em?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eighteen, nineteen inches,&#x201d; Kyle Jr. said. &#x201c;I broke off one<br>that was bigger than that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nice fish,&#x201d; Joe said, impressed.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Kyle Jr. said, his eyes worried, &#x201c;they were.&#x201d;<br><br>Inside, Kyle Sr. pointed toward The Book of Rules and Joe<br>knew then what was coming. The man slid the binder across<br>the counter and used a greasy thumb to find the right tab. Joe<br>read it: local political influence.<br><br>Kyle Sr. folded back the tab to the first page of the section,<br>and read:<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;As Ranch Manager of the Crazy Z Bar, an important part of<br>your responsibilities is to develop influential working relationships<br>with officials on the county and state level. The purpose of<br>these relationships is to further the goals of the property and implement<br>projects deemed important by the owner. Failure to secure<br>beneficial results and decisions may result in termination.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Joe contemplated that.<br><br>Kyle Sr. said, &#x201c;Mr. Dietrich thinks anything is possible if<br>you&#x2019;ve got the right relationships with the powers that be. That&#x2019;s<br>how he got to be such a rich man. He thinks all his managers<br>need to have that same ability. I guess I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that,&#x201d; Joe said. &#x201c;I was at the hearing, remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you testified against us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I did. But it wasn&#x2019;t because the proposal was sloppy or<br>you weren&#x2019;t a good man making a strong bid. The game farm<br>was rejected on its merits. It would have been the only game<br>farm in the whole state, and policy was against you from the<br>start. I think we have a lot of stupid policies, but that isn&#x2019;t one of<br>them. No one wants to be out elk hunting and run into a water<br>buffalo. Simple as that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Kyle Sr. said softly. &#x201c;But that won&#x2019;t matter to Mr.<br>Dietrich. He&#x2019;ll see it as me being a piss-poor influencer of<br>mucky-mucks. He won&#x2019;t look at the big picture and see how I&#x2019;ve<br>made our cattle operation go into the black or how I&#x2019;ve sold<br>more hay than any other manager here over the years. He&#x2019;ll look<br>at this tab and cut me loose.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe said, &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t be that unreasonable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know him like I do,&#x201d; Kyle Sr. said, shaking his<br>head. &#x201c;If someone doesn&#x2019;t do the job he wants, he cuts &#x2019;em loose.<br>Haven&#x2019;t you ever wondered why this place has gone through six<br>managers in fifteen years? I&#x2019;ve stuck the longest&#x2014;going on four<br>years. But he&#x2019;ll find out about this decision and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Joe looked up when Kyle Sr. suddenly stopped talking to see<br>what had stopped him. He followed the man&#x2019;s eyes to the outside<br>screen door, where Kyle Jr. stood on the porch.<br><br>Joe understood. No father wanted his son to think of him as<br>a failure, whether the circumstances were fair or not.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re talking,&#x201d; Kyle Sr. said to Kyle Jr.<br><br>&#x201c;Are we gonna have to move again?&#x201d; the boy asked.<br><br>Kyle Sr. raised his voice and said, &#x201c;I said we&#x2019;re talking in here,<br>son. I don&#x2019;t need you standing there listening in. You go get the<br>company truck and gas it up. You can take it into town.&#x201d;<br><br>Kyle Jr. looked back, uncomprehending. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Because Mr. Dietrich is coming for his quarterly visit. You<br>can pick him up and bring him out here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why me?&#x201d; Kyle Jr. asked, pain in his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Because your mother and me need to start packing up,&#x201d;<br>Kyle Sr. said.<br><br>From the living room, out of sight, Joe heard Joleen gasp.<br><br>To her, Kyle Sr. said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be getting what you always<br>wanted, Joleen.&#x201d;<br><br>She responded with a choked mewl.<br><br>To Joe, he said as an aside, &#x201c;She never liked this place, anyhow.<br>She&#x2019;s scared of Dietrich and she&#x2019;d like to be closer to her<br>people in Idaho. Maybe we&#x2019;ll end up there now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about Kyle Junior?&#x201d; Joe asked, after the boy had left<br>the porch.<br><br>&#x201c;He loves this place,&#x201d; he said with a heavy sigh. &#x201c;He thought<br>we&#x2019;d finally found a place for him where we could stay awhile.<br>He&#x2019;s made some friends and he&#x2019;s finally getting...</p><h2>When Animals Speak: Advanced Interspecies Communication</h2><p>A pioneer in the field of interspecies telepathic communication explores the revelations communicated by animals, including who they say they truly are, how they feel about humans, and their spiritual understanding and purposes</p><p>When Animals Speak reveals the aspects of animals as our teachers, healers, and guides through deep, life-changing revelations, communicated directly from the animals.

F. Martin company has produced some of the finest flat-top acoustic guitars in the world. Martin&#39;s designs for the shape and construction of acoustic guitars have influenced virtually every other manufacturer, and the flat-top guitar as we know it today is essentially the same as that established by Martin in the 1850s. At one time or another Martin&#39;s guitars have driven the sound of every kind of popular music, from country to pop, from bluegrass to rock&#39;n&#39;roll, and with the apparent rediscovery of acoustic music in the 1990s Martin&#39;s premier flat-top guitars are once more finding a new generation of enthusiastic musicians. The Martin Book is a fresh view of this extraordinary guitar maker, pulling together many strands of musical and manufacturing lore into o fascinating whole that illuminates Martin&#39;s long and varied history. Dozens of specially commissioned full-color photographs show every kind of Martin model, many of which came from Martin&#39;s own unique collection, and meticulous listings for collectors and enthusiasts simplify the identification of Martin instruments and detail virtually every guitar that the company has produced from the early 1830s to the 1990s.</p><p>A Songwriter and Freelance Journalist Who Has Been Part of the Nashville Music Scene for Over Fifteen Years.

Underpinning this tentative admiration, however, has been a tacit agreement that, for cultural reasons, Japanese jazz &#x201c;can&#x2019;t swing.&#x201d; In <i>Blue Nippon</i> E. Taylor Atkins shows how, strangely, Japan&#x2019;s own attitude toward jazz is founded on this same ambivalence about its authenticity. <br> Engagingly told through the voices of many musicians, <i>Blue Nippon</i> explores the true and legitimate nature of Japanese jazz. Atkins peers into 1920s dancehalls to examine the Japanese Jazz Age and reveal the origins of urban modernism with its new set of social mores, gender relations, and consumer practices. He shows how the interwar jazz period then became a troubling symbol of Japan&#x2019;s intimacy with the West&#x2014;but how, even during the Pacific war, the roots of jazz had taken hold too deeply for the &#x201c;total jazz ban&#x201d; that some nationalists desired. While the allied occupation was a setback in the search for an indigenous jazz sound, Japanese musicians again sought American validation. Atkins closes out his cultural history with an examination of the contemporary jazz scene that rose up out of Japan&#x2019;s spectacular economic prominence in the 1960s and 1970s but then leveled off by the 1990s, as tensions over authenticity and identity persisted.<br> With its depiction of jazz as a transforming global phenomenon, <i>Blue Nippon</i> will make enjoyable reading not only for jazz fans worldwide but also for ethnomusicologists, and students of cultural studies, Asian studies, and modernism.<br></p><p>&#x201c;Blue Nippon focuses on jazz in Japan but is actually much more far-reaching.

Orvell discusses Whitman and his world, then considers material culture, photography, and literature. Among the cultural figures discussed are writers Henry James, John Dos Passos, and James Agee; photographers Alfred Stieglitz and Margaret Bourke-White; and architect-designers Gustav Stickley and Frank Lloyd Wright. A witty essay on the significance of junk in the 1930s concludes the book.<br><br></p><p>"This intriguing cross-cultural look at the material world examines the day and age of the facsimile: why we copy rather than 'create,' at one level; and at another, what is reality?"-- <i>New York Times</i> <br>This book is a perceptive examination of the relationship between technology and culture. &#39;The Real Thing&#39; begins with a discussion of Walt Whitman and his world and then expands to a consideration of material culture, photography, and literature, detailing the shift from a nineteenth-century culture of imitation to an early-twentieth-century culture of authenticity.</p><h2>A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake</h2><p>Since its publication in 1939, countless would-be readers of <i>Finnegans Wake</i> - James Joyce's masterwork, which consumed a third of his life - have given up after a few pages, dismissing it as a "perverse triumph of the unintelligible." In 1944, a young professor of mythology and literature named Joseph Campbell, working with Henry Morton Robinson, wrote the first "key" or guide to entering the fascinating, disturbing, marvelously rich world of <i>Finnegans Wake.</i> The authors break down Joyce's "unintelligible" book page by page, stripping the text of much of its obscurity and serving up thoughtful interpretations via footnotes and bracketed commentary. They outline the book's basic action, and then simplify &#x2014; and clarify &#x2014; its complex web of images and allusions. <i>A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake</i> is the latest addition to the <i>Collected Works of Joseph Campbell</i> series.</p><p>Perhaps most responsible for bringing mythology to a mass audience, Joseph Campbell&#x2019;s works rank among the classics in mythology and literature: Hero with a Thousand Faces, the four-volume The Masks of God, The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers, and many others. Among his many awards, Campbell received the National Institute of Arts and Letters Award for Contribution to Creative Literature and the 1985 Medal of Honor for Literature from the National Arts Club. A past president of the American Society for the Study of Religion, Campbell was professor emeritus at Sarah Lawrence College in New York until his death in 1987.Campbell and Robinson deserve a citation from the Republic of Letters for having succeeded in bringing out their Skeleton Key at this time....The chance to be among the first to explore the wonders of <i>Finnegans Wake</i> is one of the few great intellectual and aesthetic treats that these last bad years have yielded.&#x201d;<br> <b>Edmund Wilson</b>, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br> Joyce has found in Mr. Campbell and Mr. Robinson the ideal readers who approach his book with piety, passion, and intelligence, and who have devoted several years to fashioning the key that will open its treasures.&#x201d;<br> <b>Max Lerner</b>, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br><br>"The key that will open [<i>Finnegans Wake's</i>] treasures." <i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>The Rules of Magic - Issued-Signed Edition, ISBN 9781501183331, and First Edition / First Printing</h2><p>New, and Pristine.

In direct, straightforward, and at times strikingly lyrical prose, Jamison looks back at her relationship with her husband, Richard Wyatt, a renowned scientist who battled debilitating dyslexia to become one of the foremost experts on schizophrenia. And with her characteristic honesty, candor, wit, and simplicity, she describes his death, her own long, difficult struggle with grief, and her efforts to distinguish grief from depression.<br><br>But she also recalls the great joy that Richard brought her during the nearly twenty years they had together. Wryly humorous anecdotes mingle with bittersweet memories of a relationship that was passionate and loving&#x2014;if troubled on occasion by her manic-depressive (bipolar) illness&#x2014;as Jamison reveals the ways in which her husband encouraged her to write openly about her mental illness and, through his courage and grace taught her to live fully.<br><br>A penetrating psychological study of grief viewed from deep inside the experience itself, <i>Nothing Was the Same</i> is also a deeply moving memoir by a superb writer.</p><p>Kay Redfield Jamison is Professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and codirector of the Johns Hopkins Mood Disorders Center.

Madness taught me otherwise. In the wake of my first insanity I assumed less and doubted more. My mind was suspect; there was no arguing with the new reality. I had to learn to live with a brain that demanded more coddling than I would have liked and, because of this, I avoided perturbance as best I could. Needwise, I avoided love.<br><br>I kept my mind on a short lead and my heart yet closer in; had I cared enough to look I doubt I would have recognized either of them. Before mania whipped through my brain I had been curious always to go to the far field, beyond what lay nearest by. After, I drew back from life and watered down my dreams. I retaught myself to think and to negotiate the world, and as the world measures things, I did well enough.<br><br>I was content in my life and found purpose in academic and clinical work. I wrote and taught, saw patients, and kept my struggles with manic-depressive illness to myself. I worked hard, driven to understand the illness from which I suffered. I settled in, I settled down, I settled. In a slow and fitful way, predictability insinuated itself into my life, and with it came a certain peace I was not aware had been missing. Grateful for this, and because I had no reason to know otherwise, I assumed that peace was provisional upon an absence of passion or anything that could forcibly disturb my senses. I avoided love.<br><br>This lasted for a while, although not perhaps as long as it seemed. Then I met a man who upended my cautious stance toward life. He did not believe, as I had for so long, that to control my mind I must first control my heart. He loved the woman he imagined I must have been before bowing to fear. He prodded my resistance with grace and undermined my wariness with laughter. He could say the unthinkable because he instinctively knew that his dry wit and gentle ways would win me over. They did. He was deft with my shifting moods and did not abuse our passion. He liked my fearlessness, and he brought it back as a gift to me. Far from finding<br>the intensity of my nature disturbing, he gravitated toward it. He induced me to risk much by assuming a portion of the risk himself, and he persuaded me to write from my heart. He loved in me what I had forgotten was there.<br><br>We had nearly twenty years together. He was my husband, colleague, and friend; when he became ill and we knew he would die, he became my mentor in how to die with the grace by which he lived. What he could not teach me&#x2014;no one could&#x2014;was how to contend with the grief of losing him.<br><br>It has been said that grief is a kind of madness. I disagree. There is a sanity to grief, in its just proportion of emotion to cause, that madness does not have. Grief, given to all, is a generative and human thing. It provides a path, albeit a broken one, by which those who grieve can find their way. Still, it is grief's fugitive nature that one does not know at the start that such a path exists. I knew madness well, but I understood little of grief, and I was not always certain which was grief and which was madness. Grief, as it transpires, has its own territory.</p><h2>Discovering Lehi: New Evidence of Lehi and Nephi in Arabia</h2><p>This "fascinating Mormon odyssey" was first commissioned by The Ensign. But no mention was ever made in that work of the Lihyan (Arabic transliteration for "The People of Lehi") civilization and the remarkable possibilities found in its Arabian ruins. In addition to the Hilton's original research, they have discovered volumes of new evidence and new possibilities. The findings in this book may just be the sign saying, "I, Lehi, was here." It is possible that Lehi and Nephi were actually great missionaries; that they converted thousands as hinted at in D&amp;C 33:8-10. This new evidence suggests that Arabian converts of Nephi and Levi grew in number and influence and prospered (as all civilizations of The Book of Mormon were promised) over a period of 1000 years until they actually ruled Arabia for an additional 300 years. This work may be the most remarkable evidence currently available that Levi and Nephi actually existed and may be the only research to date to actually pinpoint Book of Mormon locations with any degree of accuracy. It is astounding that the city Nephi referred to as Nahum actually exists today as a city of ancient origins. It conforms to the Book of Mormon description of the burial place of Ishmael and the point where they changed their direction of travel from south-southeast to nearly eastward toward Bountiful. Here within our very grasp may be the first physical and historical evidence that Lehi and Nephi, lived, breathed, struggled and taught the gospel as marvelous and influential prophets of The Book of Mormon.</p><p></p><h2>The Improbable Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.&#x201d;</b><br><br> The first&#x2014;and most famous&#x2014;consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes, came to the world&#x2019;s attention more than 120 years ago through Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s novels and stories. But Conan Doyle didn&#x2019;t reveal all of the Great Detective&#x2019;s adventures... <br><br> Here are the improbable adventures of Sherlock Holmes, where nothing is impossible, and nothing can be ruled out. These twenty-eight tales of mystery and the imagination detail Holmes&#x2019;s further exploits, as told by many of today&#x2019;s greatest storytellers, including Stephen King, Anne Perry, Anthony Burgess, Neil Gaiman, Naomi Novik, Stephen Baxter, Tanith Lee, Michael Moorcock, and many more. <br><br> These cases will take you from the familiar quarters at 221B Baker Street to strange alternate realities; from the gaslit streets of London to the far future.

It ends as a journey into the heart of every adventurer who ever lived ...From the author of The Last Picture Show and Texasville here is Larry McMurtry&#39;s Pulitzer Prize winning masterpiece. A powerful, triumphant portrayal of the American West as it really was. More than a love story, more than an adventure, Lonesome Dove is an epic: a monumental novel which embraces the spirit of the last defiant wilderness of America. Legend and fact, heroes and outlaws, whores and ladies, Indians and settlers Lonesome Dove is the central, enduring American experience dramatically recreated in a magnificent story of heroism and love; of honour, loyalty and betrayal.</p><p>Larry McMurtry, in books like The Last Picture Show, has depicted the modern degeneration of the myth of the American West. The subject of <b>Lonesome Dove</b>, cowboys herding cattle on a great trail-drive, seems like the very stuff of that cliched myth, but McMurtry bravely tackles the task of creating meaningful literature out of it. At first the novel seems the kind of anti-mythic, anti-heroic story one might expect: the main protagonists are a drunken and inarticulate pair of former Texas Rangers turned horse rustlers. Yet when the trail begins, the story picks up an energy and a drive that makes heroes of these men. Their mission may be historically insignificant, or pointless--McMurtry is smart enough to address both possibilities--but there is an undoubted valor in their lives. The result is a historically aware, intelligent, romantic novel of the mythic west that won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.Larry McMurtry is the author of more than thirty novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning Lonesome Dove. He has also written memoirs and essays, and received an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work on Brokeback Mountain.

But murder becomes an attraction here as well -- an especially brutal one -- when the corpse of a small-time hoodlum slain by a double-blade axe blow to the skull turns up on the fairgrounds. Jessie shouldn't get involved, having already seen too much violent death in her lifetime. But strange connections are linking the killing with a child's kidnapping . . . and with the sudden disappearance of her own beloved lead sled dog. Soon friends old and new will be pulled in as well when the unthinkable occurs: Jessie herself vanishes without a trace.</p></p><p><p>Sue Henry, whose award-winning Alaska mysteries have received the highest praise from readers and critics alike, has lived in Alaska for almost thirty years, and brings history, Alaskan lore, and the majestic beauty of the vast landscape to her mysteries. Based in Anchorage, she is currently at work on the next book in this series.</p>Anthony and Macavity Award winner Henry underutilizes her trademark Alaskan setting in her 10th Jessie Arnold mystery (after 2002's Cold Company). Told in flashbacks by the famed musher and a number of her friends and allies, the novel rarely achieves her usual level of suspense. Sitting around Jessie's cabin, the group recalls and recounts where they were, what they did and what they knew as this story of murder, dognapping and kidnapping unfolds against the backdrop of the Alaska State Fair. Despite the absence of the author's customary depiction of the magnificent and treacherous Alaskan environment, readers will welcome the return of a former suitor and the introduction of 10-year-old Danny Tabor and 82-year-old Frank Monroe. The spunky youngster and the verbose octogenarian form an unlikely but appealing alliance as they each confront the limitations placed on them by age. They also have to match wits with their pursuers when they unwittingly become possessors of important information. For Jessie, still recovering from knee surgery, this adventure tests her strength of will as she fights to find and rescue her lead dog and boon companion, Tank. Established fans should enjoy this tale, but others should start with another book in the series. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Case of the Stepdaughter&#39;s Secret (Perry Mason Mystery)</h2><p>Harlow Bissenger Bancroft is head of a corporate empire and happily married.

Flowers in the Attic, based on a true story, was her first novel. It became an immediate bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic when it was first published in 1979. Virginia Andrews died in 1986, leaving a considerable amount of unpublished work.<b>Prologue</b><br><br>Whenever the summer winds blow I hear the flowers whispering, and the leaves singing in the forest, and I see again the birds on wing, the river fish jumping. I remember, too, the winters; how the bare tree branches made tortured sounds as the cold winds whipped them about, forcing limbs to scrape the shedlike cabin that clung precariously to the steep mountainside of a range called by the West Virginian natives, the Willies.<br><br>The wind didn't just blow in the Willies, it howled and shrieked, so everyone living in the Willies had good reason for looking anxiously out their small dirty windows. Living on the mountainsides was enough to give anyone the willies -- especially when the wolves howled like the wind and the bobcats screeched and the wild things of the forests roamed at will. Often small pets would vanish, and once every decade or so an infant disappeared or a toddler wandered off and was never seen again.<br><br>With special clarity I remember one particular cold February night that revealed to me my own beginning. It was the eve of my tenth birthday. I lay close to the wood stove on my floor pallet, tossing and turning, hearing the wolves yowl at the moon. I had the unfortunate habit of sleeping lightly, so the slightest movement in the tiny cabin jolted me awake. Every sound was magnified in our isolated cabin. Granny and Grandpa snored. Pa staggered home drunk, bumping into furniture as he stumbled over sleeping bodies on the floor before he crashed down on the squealing springs of his big brass bed, waking up Ma and making her angry again so she raised her voice in shrill complaint because again he'd spent too much time in Winnerrow, in <i>Shirley's Place.</i> At that time I didn't even know why <i>Shirley's Place</i> was such a bad place, and why Pa's going there caused so much trouble.<br><br>Our cabin floor, with half-inch spacings between each crookedly laid board, let in not only cold air but also the snortings of the sleeping pigs, dogs, cats, and whatever else took retreat under it.<br><br>Out of the black suddenly came a different kind of noise. Who was moving in the darkness of the dim red glow near the stove? I strained to see it was Granny, bent over, her long gray hair streaming, making her seem a witch sliding along the rough wooden planks as quietly as possible. It couldn't be the outhouse she was heading for; Granny was the only one of us allowed to use the "hockeypot" when nature called. The rest of us had to trek two hundred yards to the outhouse. Granny was in her mid-fifties. Chronic arthritis and various other undiagnosed aches and pains made life miserable for Granny, and the loss of most of her teeth made her seem twice her age. Once, so I had been told by those old enough to remember, Annie Brandywine had been the beauty queen of the hills.<br><br>"Come, girl," Granny whispered hoarsely, her gnarled hand on my shoulder, "it's time ya stopped cryin out in t'night. I'm hopin maybe ya won't be doin it no more once ya know t'truth bout yerself. So, before yer pa wakes up agin, ya an <i>me</i> are goin somewheres, an fore we come back, ya'll have somethin t'cling ta when he glares his eyes an slings his fists." She sighed like the south wind blowing gently, whispering the tendrils of hair around my face to make them tickle like ghosts that were coming -- through her.<br><br>"You mean we're going outside? Granny, it's miserably cold out there," I warned even as I got up and pulled on a cast-off pair of Tom's too-big shoes. "You aren't planning on going far, are you?"<br><br>"Gotta," said Granny. "Hurts bad t'hear t'words my Luke yells at his own firstborn. Even worse, it makes my blood run cold t'hear ya scream right back when he can strike out an end what ain't hardly begun yet. Girl, why do ya have t'answer back?"<br><br>"You know, you know," I whispered. "Pa hates me, Granny, and I don't know why. Why does he hate me so much?"<br><br>There was enough moonlight coming through a window to allow me to see her dear old wrinkled face.<br><br>"Yes, yes, time ya knew," she mumbled, tossing me a heavy black shawl she'd knitted herself, then wrapping her own narrow, bent shoulders in another just as dark and drab. She led me to the door, swung it open, letting in the cold wind before she shut it again. In their bed beyond the tattered faded red curtain, Ma and Pa grumbled as if the wind half woke them. "We got a trip t'make, ya an me, down t'where we plant our kinfolk. Been atryin t'make it with ya fer many a year. Kin't keep puttin it off. Time runs out, it does. Then it's too late."<br><br>So on this cold, snowy, miserable, dark night she and I set off through the black piny woods. A solid sheet of ice lay rippling on the river, and the wolves sounded closer now. "Yep, Annie Brandywine Casteel sure knows how t'keep secrets," Granny said as if to herself. "Not many do, ya know, not many born like me...ya listenin, girl, are ya?"<br><br>"Can't help but hear you, Granny. You're shouting directly in my ear."<br><br>She had me by the hand, leading me a far way from home. Crazy to be out here, it was. Why, on this freezing winter's night, was she going to give up one of her precious secrets, and to me? Why me? But I loved her enough to assist her down the rough mountain trail. It seemed like miles we traveled in the dark cold of night, that old moon overhead shining down on us with evil intentions.<br><br>The treat she had in store for me was a graveyard, stark and eerie in the light of the pale bluish winter moon. The wind blew wild and fierce and snapped her thin white hair and blended it with my own before she spoke again. "Onliest thin I kin give ya, child, onliest thin worth havin, is what I'm gonna tell ya."<br><br>"Couldn't you have told me in the cabin?"<br><br>"Nah," she scoffed, stubborn as she could sometimes be, set in her ways like an old tree with too many roots. "Ya wouldn't pay no tention iffen I told ya there. <i>Here,</i> ya'll always rememba."<br><br>She hesitated as her eyes fixed on a slim little tombstone. She raised her arm and pointed her gnarled finger at the granite headstone. I stared at it and tried to read what was engraved there. How very odd for Granny to bring me here during the night, where maybe the ghosts of those who lay here roamed about looking for living bodies to inhabit.<br><br>"Ya gotta fergive yer pa fer bein what he is," intoned Granny, huddling close to me for warmth. "He's what he is, and he kin't help it no more than t'sun kin help from risin or settin, no more than t'skunks kin help from makin their stinks, an no more than ya kin help bein what ya are."<br><br>Oh, that was an easy thing for Granny to say. Old people didn't remember what it was like to be young and afraid.<br><br>"Let's go home," I said, shivering and pulling at Granny. "I've heard and read tales about what goes on in graveyards on nights when the moon is full and the hour is after midnight."<br><br>"Know betta than to be skerred of dead thins that kin't move or speak."<br><br>Yet she drew me tighter into her embrace and forced me to stare again at the narrow sunken grave. "Ya jus listen an don't say nothin till I'm finished. I got a tale t'tell that's gonna make ya feel betta. There's a good reason why yer pa speaks mean when he looks at ya. He don't really hate ya. In my mind I done put t'pieces togetha, an when my Luke looks at ya he sees <i>not</i> ya but someone else...an, chile, he really is a lovin man. A good man underneath it all. Why, he had a first wife he loved so much he near died when she did. He met her down in Atlanta. He was seventeen an she was only fourteen an three days, so she tole me lata," Her thin voice dropped an octave. "Beautiful as an angel, she was, an oh, yer pa did love her so. Why, he swept her offen her feet, when she was runnin away from home. Headin fer Texas, she was. Runnin from Boston. Had a fancy suitcase with her, full of clothes t'likes of what ya've neva seen. All kinds of pretty stuff in that suitcase, suits an silky thins, silvery brush, comb an a silver mirror, an rings fer her fingas, an jewels fer her ears, an she come here t'live, cause she went an made t'mistake of marryin up with a man not her kind...cause she loved him."<br><br>"Granny, I've never heard of Pa having a first wife. I thought Ma was his first and only wife."<br><br>"Didn't I tell ya t'stay quiet? Ya let me finish tellin this in my own way...She was from a rich Boston family. Come t'live with Luke an Toby an me. I didn't want her when she come. Didn't like her at first. Knew she wouldn't last, right from t'first, knew that. Too good fer t'likes of us, an t'hills, an t'hardships. Thought we had bathrooms, she did. Shocked her when she knew she'd have t'trek ta t'outhouse, an sit on a board with two holes. Then durn if Luke didn't go an build her a pretty lil outhouse all her own, painted it white, he did, an she put in it fancy rolled paper on a spindle, an even offered t'let me use her pink store-bought paper. Her <i>bathroom,</i> she called it. She hugged an kissed Luke fer doin that fer her."<br><br>"You mean Pa wasn't mean to her like he is to Ma?"<br><br>"Shut up, girt. Yer makin me lose track...She came, she stole my heart, maybe Toby's, too. She tried so hard t'do her best. Helpin out with t'cookin. Tryin t'make our cabin pretty. An Toby an me, we gave em our bed, so they could start their babies in t'right way an not on t'floor. She'd have slept on t'floor, she woulda, but wouldn't let her. All Casteels are made in beds...I'm ahopin an prayin anyways that's true. Well...one day she's laughin an happy cause she's gonna have a baby. My Luke's baby. An I feel so sorry, so blessed sorry. Was always ahopin she'd go back t'where she come from fore t'hills took her, t'way they do delicate folks. But she made him happy when she was here. Made him happier than he's been since." Granny stopped talking abruptly.<br><br>"How did she die, Granny? Is this her grave?"<br><br>She sighed before she continued. "Yer pa was only eighteen when she passed on, an she was still only fourteen when he had t'bury her in this cold ground an walk away an leave her alone in t'night. He knew she hated t'cold nights without him. Why, chile, he laid on her grave all t'first night t'keep her warm, an it was February...an that's my tale of her who came as an angel t'the hills, t'live an love yer pa, an make happier than he's eva been, an likely he'll neva be that happy agin, from t'looks of it."<br><br>"But why did you have to bring me out here to tell me all of this, Granny? You could have told me in the cabin. Even if it is a sad and kind of a sweet story...still, Pa's meaner than hell, and she must have taken all the best of him into the grave with her, and left only the worst for the rest of us. Why didn't she teach him how to love others? Granny, I wish she'd never come! Not ever come! Then Pa would love Ma, and he'd love me, and not her so much."<br><br>"Oh," said Granny, appearing stunned. "What's wrong with ya, girl, what's wrong? Ain't ya done guessed? That girl that yer pa called his angel, she was <i>yer ma!</i> She's the one who birthed ya, an by t'time ya come, she could hardly speak...an she named ya Heaven Leigh, she did. An ya kin't truly say, kin ya, that ya ain't proud of that name that everybody says suits ya jus fine, jus fine."<br><br>I forgot the wind. I forgot my hair snapping around my face. Forgot everything in the wonder of finding out just what and who I was.<br><br>When the moon slipped from behind a dark cloud, a random beam of light shone for an instant on the engraved name:<br><br><i>Angel<br><br>Beloved wife of Thomas Luke Casteel</i><br><br>Strange how it made me feel to see that grave. "But where did Pa find Sarah? And how did he do it so quick?"<br><br>Granny, as if eager to spill it all out while she had the chance, began to talk faster. "Well, yer pa needed a wife t'fill his empty bed. He hated his lonely nights, an men gets cravins, chile, <i>physical</i> cravins yer gonna find out bout one day when yer old enough. He wanted a wife t'give him what his angel had, an she tried, give Sarah credit fer that. She made ya a good motha, treated ya like ya were her own. Nursed ya, loved ya. An Sarah gave Luke her body willingly enough, but she had nothin of his angel's spirit t'give him, an that leaves him still yearnin fer t'girl who would have made him a betta man. He <i>was</i> betta then, chile Heaven -- even if ya don't believe it. Why, in t'days when yer angel ma were alive he'd set out fer work early each mornin, drivin his old pickup truck down t'Winnerrow where he was learnin all about carpentry an how t'build houses an such. He used t'come home full of nice talk about buildin us all a new house down in t'valley, an when he had that house, he were gonna work t'land, raise cows, pigs, an horses...yer pa, he's always had a keenin fer animals. Loves em, he does, like ya do, chile Heaven. Ya get that from him."<br><br>Odd how I felt when Granny took me back to the cabin, and from beneath a clutter of old junk, and many old cartons in which we kept our pitifully few clothes, she dragged out something wrapped about in an old quilt. From that she extracted an elegant suitcase, the kind mountain folks like us could never afford. "Yers," she whispered so the others wouldn't wake up and intrude on this most private moment. "Belonged t'yer ma. Promised her I'd give it t'ya when t'time were right. Figure it's as right as it'll eva be t'night, now...so look, girl, look. See what kind of ma ya had."<br><br>As if a dead mother could be compressed and put into a fancy, expensive suitcase!<br><br>But when I looked, I gasped.<br><br>There before me in the dim firelit room were the most beautiful clothes I'd ever seen. Such delicate lacy things I hadn't dreamed existed...and at the very bottom I found something long, and carefully wrapped in dozens of sheets of tissue paper. I could tell from Granny's expression she was tense, watching me closely, as if to savor my reaction.<br><br>In the dim glow of the woodfire burning I stared at a doll. A doll? What I'd expected least to find. I gazed and gazed at the doll with the silvery-gold hair bound up in a fancy way. She wore a wedding veil, the filmy mist flowing out from a tiny jeweled cap. Her face was exceptionally pretty, with beautifully shaped bowed lips, the upper cleft ridge fitting so precisely into the bottom center indentation. Her long dress was made of white lace, lavishly embroidered with tiny pearls and sparkling beads. A bride doll...veil and everything. Even her white shoes were lace and white satin, with sheer stockings fastened to a tiny garter belt, as I saw when I took a peak under the skirts and veil.<br><br>"It's her. Yer ma. Luke's angel that was named Leigh," whispered Granny, "jus t'way yer ma looked when she came here afta she married up with yer pa. Last thin she said before she died was, 'Give what I brought with me to my little girl...'An now I have."<br><br>Yes, now she had.<br><br>And in so doing, she'd changed the course of my life.<br><br><b>Chapter 1:The Way It Used To Be</b><br><br>If Jesus died almost two thousand years ago to save us all from the worst we had in us, he'd failed in our area, except on Sundays between the hours of ten A.M. and noon.

Worthy as onion peelings, I thought, as I pondered how Pa had married Sarah two months after my mother died in childbirth -- and he'd loved his "angel" so much.

The Cazalet Chronicles &#34;The Light Years&#34;, &#34;Marking Time&#34;, &#34;Confusion&#34;, &#34;Casting Off&#34;, and &#34;All Change&#34; have become established as modern classics and have been adapted for a major BBC television series and most recently for BBC Radio 4. In 2002 she was appointed commander to the Order of the British Empire.A perfect if inauspicious title for this second course of Howard's Cazalet Chronicles (begun with The Light Years, 1990), since this latest is all idling before something big happens--as the Cazalet writer-to-be, Clary, puts it, ``We need people to be in love with....We'll just have to wait.'' The waiting begins right after Chamberlain's ``peace with honor'' falls through and Hitler marches into Poland. At the Sussex manse of ``Brig'' Cazalet--now a blind old duffer shepherded around by his faithful spinster daughter, Rachel--the much extended Cazalet family gathers with their gas masks, not to mention orphaned babies (one of Rachel's charity), wounded soldiers, and London evacuees. The Brig's eldest son, Hugh, lamed during the Great War, stays at home to blunder along with the family timber firm and to coddle his wife, Sybil, who has incurable cancer; middle son, Edward, the womanizer, joins up, spending weekend leaves sexually abusing his beautifully budding daughter, Louise, while his wife, Villy, develops a crush on a conductor; and the last son, Rupert, goes missing in action right before his young wife, Zoe, has a baby. In addition, Howard focuses on the children of this crew, including: 17-year-old Louise, who attends acting school; Clary, Rupert's daughter by his late first wife, who nicely copes with her airheaded stepmother and fills her journal feverishly; and Polly, whose chief attribute is her goodness. By the end, Japan has drawn the US into the war; there's word of Rupert, possible romance for Clary, and as always, the Cazalets marching ever on. Comfortable, literate, but very slow lane. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Rain plummeted from a leaden sky and a blustery wind blew the chill of mortality through the mourners clustered in St. George&#x2019;s churchyard. It was early May, but it felt like the raw end of March.</p><p>The funeral was well attended, despite the dismal weather. CLOSED signs dangled in shop windows throughout the small village of Finch, and cottage curtains, so often twitched aside to allow one inquisitive neighbor to observe another, hung motionless. Everyone who was anyone stood shivering in the churchyard, and in Finch, everyone was someone.</p><p>Short, plump Sally Pyne, tearoom owner and baker extraordinaire, shared an umbrella with her equally plump fianc�, Henry Cook. Christine and Dick Peacock, the pub&#x2019;s well-fed proprietors, served as a human windbreak for the more slightly built retired railroad employee, George Wetherhead. Ruddy-cheeked Mr. Malvern, a local dairy farmer, stood beside Grant Tavistock and Charles Bellingham, whose business was the purchase, sale, and restoration of fine art.</p><p>Near the three men, draped in a black woolen cape that hung to her ankles, stood Finch&#x2019;s resident witch, Miranda Morrow, who&#x2019;d left her holistic health hotline unattended in order to pay her respects to the deceased. The presence of a pagan at a Christian burial might have raised eyebrows in a less tightly knit community, but Miranda&#x2019;s neighbors were accustomed to her funny little ways.</p><p>Four women&#x2014;two widows and two spinsters, all retired&#x2014;huddled together for warmth in the lee of a marble angel. Elspeth Binney, Opal Taylor, Selena Buxton, and Millicent Scroggins never missed a funeral if they could help it, but their patented piety was, on this occasion, undercut by the volley of resentful glances they cast at a fifth woman, Amelia Thistle. Amelia had wounded them grievously by winning the heart of the village&#x2019;s most eligible widower, who happened to be my father-in-law. The quarrelsome quartet had almost forgiven Amelia for succeeding so spectacularly where they had failed, but the cold rain had made them cranky.</p><p>Peggy and Jasper Taxman occupied their usual positions at the forefront of the assembly. Mild-mannered Jasper Taxman was a mere blip on the village&#x2019;s radar, but his wife was a supernova. Peggy Taxman ran the post office, the general store, the greengrocer&#x2019;s shop, and every village-wide event in Finch, and she did so imperiously, with an iron hand and a voice that could crack granite. None but the brave would dare to question Peggy&#x2019;s right to plant her Wellington-booted feet wherever she chose to plant them.</p><p>By contrast, Mr. Barlow, who was the church sexton and village handyman, stood at a respectful distance from the grave, while Bree Pym, the twenty-year-old New Zealander who&#x2019;d helped Mr. Barlow to lower the coffin into its final resting place, rested her muddy hands on the headstone shared by her great-grandaunts, Ruth and Louise Pym, whose house and modest fortune she had inherited. Brave Bree rarely missed an opportunity to goad Peggy Taxman, but she&#x2019;d sheathed her sharp wit for the day and watched the proceedings in solemn silence.</p><p>I, too, stood in the churchyard, along with my husband, Bill, and our eight-year-old twins, Will and Rob. My father-in-law, William Willis, Sr., had hoped to join us, but as he&#x2019;d only recently recovered from a nasty inflammation of the lungs, he&#x2019;d been ordered by his physician, his housekeeper, his gardener, his son, his daughter-in-law, and his sweetheart to stay at home.</p><p>My best friend, Emma Harris, had also been unable to attend the funeral because of illness, though in her case it was a horse&#x2019;s illness rather than her own. Pegasus, Emma&#x2019;s beloved chestnut mare, had been diagnosed with a mild case of colic, which had been all the excuse Emma had needed to spend the day in a nice, dry barn. She&#x2019;d acknowledged the gravity of the occasion by canceling the day&#x2019;s classes at her riding academy, but since horses could not be relied upon to clean their own stalls, her staff and stable hands had been too busy to come to St. George&#x2019;s.</p><p>Theodore Bunting, Finch&#x2019;s vicar, stood in his customary place at the foot of the grave. While he struggled to control his prayer book&#x2019;s flapping pages, his wife, Lilian Bunting, attempted to shield him from the worst of the wind with a large black umbrella.</p><p>As the vicar spoke of dust and ashes, the eyes of the congregation darted furtively from the rain-dappled coffin to Lilian&#x2019;s umbrella, which tilted alarmingly with each passing gust. The men and women in the churchyard were too mature to speak their thoughts aloud, but my sons were not.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Bunting is going to fly straight over the church if she doesn&#x2019;t let go of that umbrella,&#x201d; Rob observed dispassionately.</p><p>&#x201c;Like Mary Poppins,&#x201d; added Will. &#x201c;Only older.&#x201d;</p><p>Bill emitted a brief but regrettably audible snort of laughter. I elbowed him in the ribs and quelled Will and Rob with a look, but the damage was done. Mr. Barlow snickered, Bree Pym giggled, and soon the only shoulders that weren&#x2019;t quivering with suppressed mirth belonged to Peggy Taxman, whose gimlet gaze eventually silenced the unseemly tittering.</p><p>The good people of Finch weren&#x2019;t given to giggling at funerals. Finch was a tiny hamlet set amid the rolling hills and the patchwork fields of England&#x2019;s Cotswolds region. Although Bill and I were Americans, we&#x2019;d lived in a honey-colored cottage near Finch for a decade. Our sons had never known another home.</p><p>Bill&#x2019;s widowed father completed our family circle. Will and Rob had the run of their grandfather&#x2019;s splendidly restored Georgian mansion, but the wrought-iron gates guarding his estate kept less welcome visitors&#x2014;Elspeth Binney, Opal Taylor, Selena Buxton, and Millicent Scroggins, to be precise&#x2014;at bay.</p><p>While Willis, Sr., tended his orchids and courted Amelia Thistle, Bill ran the international branch of his family&#x2019;s venerable law firm from an office overlooking the village green, the twins attended Morningside School in the nearby market town of Upper Deeping, and I juggled the ever-changing roles of wife, mother, daughter-in-law, friend, neighbor, gossip monitor, and community volunteer. Over the years, Bill, Will, Rob, Willis, Sr., and I had become vital threads in the fabric of our village and we did our best to keep the cloth intact.</p><p>We could do little, however, to repair the gaping hole left by a villager&#x2019;s death. In a tiny place like Finch, the loss of a neighbor usually sent shock waves of grief through every household. As a rule, a death in Finch was regarded as a death in the family, and no one with the faintest sense of decency would laugh during a family funeral.</p><p>Mr. Hector Huggins, however, was the exception that proved the rule. His death hadn&#x2019;t sent so much as a ripple of grief through Finch, not because he&#x2019;d been disliked, but because he&#x2019;d lived among us as a stranger. In a village where everyone knew virtually everything about everyone else, Mr. Huggins had managed the miraculous feat of remaining anonymous.</p><p>A few useless things were, of course, known about him. He&#x2019;d been a senior partner in an accounting firm in Upper Deeping. He&#x2019;d patronized local businesses, attended local events, and never missed a Sunday service at St. George&#x2019;s, but he&#x2019;d made neither friends nor enemies in the village. He&#x2019;d simply made no impression at all. Bill had once described him as a wallpaper man, someone who hovered quietly in the background, unable or unwilling to involve himself in other people&#x2019;s lives.</p><p>Upon his retirement, Mr. Huggins had taken to spending his afternoons sitting silently on the bench near the war memorial and his evenings fishing silently from atop the humpbacked bridge at the south end of the village green. No one knew how he&#x2019;d spent his mornings, but it seemed likely that he&#x2019;d spent them in silence.</p><p>Mr. Huggins had lived in Ivy Cottage, a modest stone dwelling across the lane from my father-in-law&#x2019;s estate, but since Ivy Cottage was completely hidden from view by a tall hedgerow, it was possible to drive past it many times without knowing it was there. Neighborly concern had prompted me to call on Mr. Huggins from time to time, but I&#x2019;d never set foot inside his front gate. He&#x2019;d always turned me away at the gate with a gentle smile and the soft-spoken assurance that he required no assistance.</p><p>Neither I nor my neighbors had known that Mr. Huggins was ailing until an ambulance had arrived at Ivy Cottage to take him on what had proved to be his final journey. He&#x2019;d died ten days later in the hospital in Upper Deeping. Shortly thereafter, the vicar had received a letter from a London solicitor containing the payment as well as the arrangements for Mr. Huggins&#x2019;s funeral, but whether the same solicitor would handle the disposal of his late client&#x2019;s worldly goods, no one could tell.</p><p>A faint communal memory suggested that Mr. Huggins had relatives living abroad, but none had shown up to bury him. Mr. Malvern, Dick Peacock, Henry Cook, and Grant Tavistock had volunteered to serve as Mr. Huggins&#x2019;s pallbearers, but it had been left to the vicar to eulogize him because no one else could think of anything to say.</p><p>The vicar had done what he could with an awkward situation, basing his sermon on a pair of verses in which St. Paul exhorted his brethren &#x201c;to aspire to live quietly, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so that you may command the respect of outsiders, and be dependent on nobody.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Huggins hadn&#x2019;t worked with his hands, exactly, and the villagers had bristled slightly at the suggestion that they might have been regarded as &#x201c;outsiders&#x201d; by a man who&#x2019;d never made the least effort to become a part of the community, but they couldn&#x2019;t deny that their late neighbor had lived quietly, minded his own affairs, and depended on nobody but himself. The general feeling seemed to be that, if self-reliance were a virtue, then Mr. Huggins had earned his place in Heaven.</p><p>What he had not earned was a place in our hearts. I doubted that anyone in the churchyard felt a deep and abiding sense of loss at his passing. They might have felt pity for a man whose family had, apparently, abandoned him. They might have regretted their failure to get to know him better. They might even have felt sorry for not feeling sorrier about his death. But no one was heartbroken.</p><p>I suspected that the vast majority of my neighbors had, like myself, come to Mr. Huggins&#x2019;s funeral out of a sense of duty, and a sense of duty could hardly be counted on to inoculate them against a contagious bout of giggling. Even so, we all looked a bit shamefaced after our indecorous descent into comedy, and redoubled our efforts to appear somber. A neighbor had died, he had no one to mourn him, and we owed it to the honor of our village to see him off properly.</p><p>The vicar was about to drop a morsel of mud on the coffin when he was distracted by a commotion in the lane. Heads that had been bowed rose alertly as a white Ford Focus splashed to a halt on the grassy verge beyond the lych-gate, and the vicar&#x2019;s hand fell to his side as a tall figure leapt from the car, vaulted the churchyard&#x2019;s low stone wall, and sprinted across the sodden grass, dodging nimbly between headstones and skidding to a halt mere inches from Mr. Huggins&#x2019;s open grave.</p><p>The newcomer was a young man&#x2014;in his midtwenties, perhaps. He was dressed in a dark-brown rain jacket, khaki cargo shorts, and a pair of rugged hiking sandals, and though his clothes were slightly shabby, he was much more than slightly good-looking. His blond hair was like tousled corn silk, his eyes were as blue as a summer sky, and his deeply tanned face made his teeth seem almost too white. Even his toes, which were rapidly turning pink in the cold air, were handsome. As he paused to catch his breath I could sense hearts fluttering among the faithful, but though many mouths had fallen open, words seemed to be in short supply.</p><p>Once again, a child led us.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; Will said brightly. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jack MacBride,&#x201d; the young man replied in a broad Australian accent. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve come to say good-bye to Uncle Hector.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>The young man gave Will a friendly wink, then turned to face the vicar.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the right place, aren&#x2019;t I, Padre?&#x201d; he inquired anxiously. &#x201c;St. George&#x2019;s church? In Finch? Only, Finch wasn&#x2019;t on my map, so I had to stop in Upper Deeping for directions and the bloke who gave them to me was a bit of a wally.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Calm yourself, Mr. MacBride,&#x201d; the vicar said gently. &#x201c;You are in the correct place. You may, if you wish, be the first to cast earth into your uncle&#x2019;s grave.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Beauty,&#x201d; said Jack.</p><p>He scooped a heaping handful of mud from the mound near the grave and let it fall with a mighty splat on the coffin lid. The gruesome noise broke the spell he&#x2019;d cast over the churchyard. Gaping mouths snapped shut, astonished gazes were averted, and the ancient ritual continued as if a golden-haired Adonis hadn&#x2019;t burst upon the scene like a ray of sunshine.</p><p>The women stepped forward to drop damp posies into the grave and the men contributed modest lumps of dirt, but Will and Rob, delighted by Jack MacBride&#x2019;s exuberance, had to be restrained from hurling great gobs of mud in the grave&#x2019;s general direction. Bill and I clamped our hands onto their shoulders until the vicar had pronounced the final blessing.</p><p>Amelia Thistle nodded sympathetically to Jack, then strode off to visit her recuperating beau in his graceful Georgian home, but the rest of the villagers formed a line and shuffled past the newcomer, studying him covertly while murmuring impromptu words of condolence. Bill and I allowed the boys to throw one small mud-ball apiece into the grave, then joined the vicar and Lilian at the end of the line, while our neighbors lingered near the lych-gate to await developments.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very sorry for your loss, Mr. MacBride,&#x201d; the vicar began.</p><p>&#x201c;Jack&#x2019;ll do,&#x201d; the young man interjected. &#x201c;Mr. MacBride&#x2019;s my dad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very sorry for your loss, Jack,&#x201d; the vicar began anew. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Theodore Bunting, vicar of the parish.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m Lilian Bunting, Teddy&#x2019;s wife,&#x201d; said Lilian, furling her troublesome umbrella. &#x201c;Please allow me to introduce our friends: Bill Willis, his wife, Lori, and their sons, Will and Rob.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;G&#x2019;day,&#x201d; said Jack, with a nod to each of us.</p><p>&#x201c;Your feet look cold,&#x201d; said Rob.</p><p>&#x201c;They are, a bit,&#x201d; Jack admitted.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you have socks on?&#x201d; inquired Will.</p><p>&#x201c;And why are you wearing shorts?&#x201d; Rob added.</p><p>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s hot where I come from,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;My warm clothes are at the bottom of my pack and I didn&#x2019;t have time to fish them out.&#x201d; He looked apologetically at the vicar. &#x201c;Sorry for buggering up the ceremony, Mr. Bunting. I&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve been here sooner, but my plane was late getting into Heathrow and it took for-bloody-ever to rent a halfway decent car and traffic was a bloody nightmare because half the bloody roads were flooded and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Apology accepted,&#x201d; the vicar bro...</p></p><h2>Tuning the Diamonds</h2><p>The evolution of humankind is at hand and massive change is underway.

Combine the two and you have this delightfully different anthology on the art and craft of murder, in which the likes of knitting needles, handblown glass, wood files, and adhesives prove to be implements of a nastier sort of handiwork.</p><p>Maggie Bruce, the creator of the Lili Marino series, is otherwise known as Marilyn Wallace, editor of the award-winning five-volume Sisters in Crime anthologies, co-editor of Deadly Allies, and the author of several mystery and suspense novels.It's not all murder, she said, and it's certainly one of the most unusual amalgamations between two covers. Editor and writer Bruce has concocted a real whodunit how-to by assembling 15 award-winning, homicide-oriented authors, asking them to incorporate a craft whimsy somewhere in the plot, including an actual pattern and brief history, then compiling. Gillian Roberts' "Ellie's Chair" introduces readers to double trouble: flea markets and painted wood furniture. Weaver Parnell Hall gives Coach Crandall his just and deadly rewards, and subsequently explains the intricacies of this woven necklace. Stories, though anthology---size, do make for some great reading and guessing, but many of the 15 crafts are often treated without much attention to instructions and details--and are sans illustrations or photographs. Appended are lists of museums and artisan centers, shows and festivals, publications, guilds and organizations, craft supplies, and instructions. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Munroe, endearingly known as 'The Commodore,' needs no introduction. A pioneer, who first felt the charm of that palm and pine-fringed coast over 50 years ago, when the end of the peninsula was as inaccessible as the western plateau in the days of the covered wagon, he soon succumbed to the lure of the country and became one of its early settlers, building a home in what was then practically a wilderness, and is now within the boundaries of a large city. <br><br>In the development of the lower east coast of Florida he played a quiet but important part. to those who knew him it is easy to believe that his personality, his friendliness, and his good will were in a measure as responsible for attracting those who early followed his lead in settling the coast near the mouth of the Miami River, as were the climate and other features which have made the shores of Biscayne Bay irresistible to many. <br><br>Ralph Munroe was a seaman before he went to Biscayne Bay, but the waters and life there gave him an opportunity to develop his love of boats, and to turn his talents to the designing a sailing craft that was peculiarly suited to shoal water, and was also so seaworthy as to be able to make the long runs up and down the coast outside, and to stand up in the rough waters of the Gulf Stream. <br><br>These reminiscences of a long, useful and interesting life have grown from a simple note-book which Munroe started originally for the benefit of his children, in order that the pioneer days of the country he loved and which he did so much to develop should not be forgotten.</p><p></p><h2>Keeping an Eye Open: Essays on Art</h2><p>An extraordinary collection&#x2014;hawk-eyed and understanding&#x2014;from the Man Booker Prize&#x2013;winning, best-selling author of <i>The Sense of an Ending </i>and <i>Levels of Life</i>.<br><br> As Julian Barnes notes: &#x201c;Flaubert believed that it was impossible to explain one art form in terms of another, and that great paintings required no words of explanation. Braque thought the ideal state would be reached when we said nothing at all in front of a painting . . . But it is a rare picture that stuns, or argues, us into silence. And if one does, it is only a short time before we want to explain and understand the very silence into which we have been plunged.&#x201d;<br><br> This is the exact dynamic that informs his new book. In his 1989 novel <i>A History of the World in 10� Chapters,</i> Barnes had a chapter on G�ricault&#x2019;s <i>The Raft of the Medusa,</i> and since then he has written about many great masters of nineteenth- and twentieth-century art, including Delacroix, Manet, Fantin-Latour, C�zanne, Degas, Redon, Bonnard, Vuillard, Vallotton, Braque, Magritte, Oldenburg, Lucian Freud and Howard Hodgkin. The seventeen essays gathered here help trace the arc from Romanticism to Realism and into Modernism; they are adroit, insightful and, above all, a true pleasure to read.</p><p><b>JULIAN BARNES</b>&nbsp;is the author of twenty previous books, for which he has received the Man Booker Prize, the Somerset Maugham Award, the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, the David Cohen Prize for Literature and the E.

Those on board crowded the poop and the breastwork, marvelling at the animals&#x2019; ability to circle a vessel already gaily proceeding at nine or ten knots. But as they watched the sporting of the porpoises, a cry was raised. A cabin boy had fallen through one of the fore portholes on the larboard side. A signal gun was fired, a life-raft thrown out, and the vessel hove to. But these manoeuvres were cumbrously done, and by the time the six-oared barge was let down, it was in vain. They could not find the raft, let alone the boy. He was only fifteen years old, and those who knew him maintained that he was a strong swimmer; they conjectured that he would most probably have reached the raft. If so, he doubtless perished upon it, after having experienced the most cruel sufferings.<br><br>The expedition for Senegal consisted of four vessels: a frigate, a corvette, a flute and a brig. It had set sail from the Island of Aix on 17th June 1816 with 365 people on board. Now it continued south with its complement reduced by one. They provisioned at Tenerife, taking on precious wines, oranges, lemons, banian figs and vegetables of all kinds. Here they noted the depravity of the local inhabitants: the women of Saint Croix stood at their doors and urged the Frenchmen to enter, confident that their husbands&#x2019; jealousies would be cured by the monks of the Inquisition who would speak disapprovingly of conjugal mania as the blinding gift of Satan. Reflective passengers ascribed such behaviour to the southern sun, whose power, it is known, weakens both natural and moral bonds.<br><br>From Tenerife they sailed south-south-west. Fresh winds and navigational ineptitude scattered the flotilla. Alone, the frigate passed the tropic and rounded Cape Barbas. It was running close to the shore, at times no more than half a cannon shot away. The sea was strewn with rocks; brigantines could not frequent these seas at low water. They had doubled Cape Blanco, or so they believed, when they found themselves in shallows; the lead was cast every half-hour. At daybreak Mr. Maudet, ensign of the watch, made out the reckoning upon a chicken coop, and judged that they were on the edge of the Arguin reef. His advice was discounted. But even those unschooled in the sea could observe that the water had changed colour; weed was apparent at the ship&#x2019;s side, and a great many fish were being taken. In calm seas and clear weather, they were running aground. The lead announced eighteen fathoms, then shortly afterwards six fathoms. The frigate, luffing, almost immediately gave a heel; a second and third, then stopped. The sounding line showed a depth of five metres and sixty centimetres.<br><br>By misfortune, they had struck the reef at high tide; and the seas growing violent, attempts to free the ship failed. The frigate was assuredly lost. Since the boats it carried were not capacious enough to contain the whole personnel, it was decided to build a raft and embark upon it those who could not be put into the boats. The raft would then be towed to the shore and all would be saved. This plan was perfectly well laid; but as two of the company were later to affirm, it was traced upon loose sand, which was dispersed by the breath of egotism.<br><br>The raft was made, and well made, places in the boats allotted, provisions made ready. At daybreak, with two metres and seventy centimetres of water in the hold and the pumps failing, the order was given to abandon ship. Yet disorder quickly embraced the well-laid plan. The allotment of places was ignored, and the provisions were carelessly handled, forgotten or lost in the waters. One hundred and fifty was to be the complement of the raft: 120 soldiers, including officers, twenty-nine sailors and male passengers, one woman. But scarcely had fifty men got on board this machine&#x2014;whose extent was twenty metres in length and seven in breadth&#x2014;than it sank under the water to a depth of at least seventy centimetres. They cast off the barrels of flour which had been embarked, whereupon the level of the raft rose; the remaining people descended upon it, and it sank again. When the machine was fully laden, it was a metre beneath the surface, and those on board so crowded they could not take a single step; at the back and front, they were in water up to the waist. Loose flour barrels were cast against them by the waves; a twenty-five-pound bag of biscuit was thrown down to them, which the water converted at once into a paste.<br><br>It had been intended that one of the naval officers should take command of the raft; but this officer declined to come on board. At seven o&#x2019;clock in the morning the signal for departure was given, and the little flotilla pulled away from the abandoned frigate. Seventeen persons had refused to leave the vessel, or had concealed themselves away, and thus remained on board to discover their fate.<br><br>The raft was towed by four boats in line astern, preceded by a pinnace, which made soundings. As the boats took up their positions, cries of Vive le roi! arose from the men on the raft, and a small white flag was raised upon the end of a musket. But it was at this instant of greatest hope and expectation for those upon the raft that the breath of egotism was added to the normal winds of the sea. One by one, whether for reason of self-interest, incompetence, misfortune or seeming necessity, the tow-ropes were cast aside.<br><br>The raft was barely two leagues from the frigate when it was abandoned. Those on board had wine, a little brandy, some water and a small portion of sodden biscuit. They had been given no compass or chart. With neither oars nor rudder, there was no means of controlling the raft, and little means either of controlling those upon it, who were constantly flung against one another as the waters rolled over them. In the first night, a storm got up and threw the machine with great violence; the cries of those on board mingled with the roaring of the billows. Some attached ropes to the timbers of the craft, and held fast to these; all were buffeted without mercy. By daybreak the air was filled with lamentable cries; vows which could never be fulfilled were offered up to Heaven, and all prepared themselves for imminent death. It was impossible to form an idea of that first night which was not below the truth.<br><br>The next day the seas were calm, and for many hope was rekindled. Nevertheless, two young lads and a baker, convinced that there was no escape from death, bade farewell to their companions and willingly embraced the sea. It was during this day that those on the raft began to experience their first delusions. Some fancied that they saw land, others espied vessels come to save them, and the dashing of these deceptive hopes upon the rocks provoked greater despondency.<br><br>The second night was more terrible than the first. The seas were mountainous and the raft constantly near to being overthrown; the officers, clustered by the short mast, ordered the soldiery from one side of the machine to the other to counterbalance the energy of the waves. A group of men, certain that they were lost, broke open a cask of wine and resolved to soothe their last moments by abandoning the power of reason; in which they succeeded, until the sea water coming in through the hole they had made in the cask spoiled the wine. Thus doubly maddened, these disordered men determined to send all to a common destruction, and to this end attacked the ropes that bound the raft together. The mutineers being resisted, a pitched battle took place amid the waves and the darkness of the night. Order was restored, and there was an hour of tranquillity upon that fatal machine. But at midnight the soldiery rose again and attacked their superiors with knives and sabres; those without weapons were so deranged that they attempted to tear at the officers with their teeth, and many bites were endured. Men were thrown into the sea, bludgeoned, stabbed; two barrels of wine were thrown overboard and the last of the water. By the time the villains were subdued, the raft was laden with corpses.<br><br>During the first uprising, a workman by the name of Dominique, who had joined the mutineers, was cast into the sea. On hearing the piteous cries of this treacherous underling, the engineer in charge of the workmen threw himself into the water and, taking the villain by the hair, succeeded in dragging him back on board. Dominique&#x2019;s head had been split open by a sabre. In the darkness the wound was bound up and the wretch restored to life. But no sooner was he so revived than ingratitude overtook him; he joined the mutineers and rose with them again. This time he found less fortune and less mercy; he perished that night.<br><br>Delirium now menaced the unhappy survivors. Some threw themselves into the sea; some fell into torpor; some unfortunate wretches rushed at their comrades with sabres drawn, demanding to be given the wing of a chicken. The engineer whose bravery had saved the workman Dominique pictured himself travelling the fine plains of Italy, and one of the officers saying to him, &#x201c;I remember that we have been deserted by the boats; but fear nothing; I have just written to the governor, and in a few hours we will be saved.&#x201d; The engineer, calm in his delirium, responded thus: &#x201c;Have you a pigeon to carry your orders with as much celerity?&#x201d;<br><br>Only one cask of wine remained for the sixty still on board the raft. They collected tags from the soldiers and fashioned them into fish-hooks; they took a bayonet and bent it into such shape as to catch a shark. Whereupon a shark arrived, and seized the bayonet, and with a savage twist of its jaw straightened it fully out again, and swam away.<br><br>An extreme resource proved necessary to prolong their miserable existence. Some of those who had survived the night of the mutiny fell upon the corpses and hacked pieces from them, devouring the flesh upon the instant. Most of the officers refused this meat; though one proposed that it should first be dried to make it more palatable. Some tried chewing sword-belts and cartouche boxes, and the leather trimmings to their hats, with little benefit. One sailor attempted to eat his own excrement, but he could not succeed.<br><br>The third day was calm and fine. They took repose, but cruel dreams added to the horrors already inflicted by hunger and thirst. The raft, which now carried less than one half its original complement, had risen up in the water, an unforeseen benefit of the night&#x2019;s mutinies. Yet those on board remained in water to the knees, and could only repose standing up, pressed against one another in a solid mass. On the fourth morning they perceived that a dozen of their fellows had died in the night; the bodies were given to the sea, except for one that was reserved against their hunger. At four o&#x2019;clock that afternoon a shoal of flying fish passed over the raft, and many became ensnared in the extremities of the machine. That night they dressed the fish, but their hunger was so great and each portion so exiguous that many of them added human flesh to the fish, and the flesh being dressed was found less repugnant. Even the officers began to eat it when presented in this form.<br><br>It was from this day onwards that all learned to consume human flesh. The next night was to bring a fresh supply. Some Spaniards, Italians and Negroes, who had remained neutral during the first mutinies, conspired together with the plan of throwing their superiors overboard and escaping to the shore, which they believed to be at hand, with those valuables and possessions that had been placed into a bag and hung upon the mast. Once more, a terrible combat ensued, and blood washed over the fatal raft. When this third mutiny was finally suppressed, there remained no more than thirty on board, and the raft had risen yet again in the water. Barely a man lay without wounds, into which salt water constantly flowed, and piercing cries were heard.<br><br>On the seventh day two soldiers concealed themselves behind the last barrel of wine. They struck a hole in it and began to drink the wine through a straw. On being discovered, the two trespassers were instantly cast into the water, in accordance with the necessary law that had been promulgated.<br><br>It was now that the most terrible decision came to be taken. On counting their numbers, it was found that they were twenty-seven. Fifteen of these were likely to live for some days; the rest, suffering from large wounds and many of them delirious, had but the smallest chance of survival. In the time that might elapse before their deaths, however, they would surely diminish further the limited supply of provisions. It was calculated that they could well drink between them as many as thirty or forty bottles of wine. To put the sick on half-allowance was to kill them by degrees. And thus, after a debate in which the most dreadful despair presided, it was agreed among the fifteen healthy persons that their sick comrades must, for the common good of those who might yet survive, be cast into the sea. Three sailors and a soldier, their hearts now hardened by the constant sight of death, performed these repugnant but necessary executions. The healthy were separated from the unhealthy like the clean from the unclean.<br><br>After this cruel sacrifice, the last fifteen survivors threw all their arms into the water, reserving only a sabre lest some rope or wood might need cutting. There was sustenance left for six days while they awaited death.<br><br>Then came a small event which each interpreted according to his nature. A white butterfly, of a species common in France, appeared over their heads fluttering, and settled upon the sail. To some, crazed with hunger, it seemed that even this could make a morsel. To others, the ease with which their visitor moved appeared a very mockery of those who lay exhausted and almost motionless beneath it. To yet others, this simple butterfly was a sign, a messenger from Heaven as white as Noah&#x2019;s dove. Even those sceptical ones who declined to recognise a divine instrument knew that butterflies travel little distance from the dry land, and were raised by cautious hope.</p><h2>Cat Shout for Joy: A Joe Grey Mystery (Joe Grey Mystery Series)</h2><p><p>Awaiting the birth of his first kittens, feline P. I. Joe Grey, his companion Dulcie, and their furry sleuthing pals must unmask a killer preying on some of the most vulnerable citizens in the charming California coastal community of Molena Point.</p><p>For Joe Grey and Dulcie, life is a bittersweet mix of endings and beginnings. While they joyfully await their first litter, they are also sad for their friend, the old yellow cat Misto, whose time on earth is drawing to an end. But Misto tells them an exciting future awaits: among the litter will be a little calico returned from the distant past who will be born with the same ancient markings, and the adventurous spirit of Joe Grey.</p><p>While the proud parents await the birth of their babies, their humans have their hands full with projects of their own. Kate Osborne has bought the old Pamillon estate and Ryan Flannery is building a new cat shelter as part of their volunteer rescue project. The criminals are busy, too. The Molena Point PD has stepped up patrols to apprehend a mugger attacking the local elderly. The case becomes a homicide when one of the victims dies, leaving everyone in the town&#x2014;including Joe and Grey and his furry sleuthing companions&#x2014;on edge, just when the kittens are about to arrive. When Dulcie gives birth, her little calico is just as Misto predicted, as if she has come back to the world from mythic ancient times.</p><p>But the celebrations will have to wait. A murderer is on the loose&#x2014;and neither young nor old is safe until the culprit is found.</p></p><p><p>Shirley Rousseau Murphy is the author of twenty mysteries in the Joe Grey series, for which she has won the Cat Writers&#x2019; Association Muse Medallion nine years running, and has received ten national Cat Writers&#x2019; Association Awards for best novel of the year. She is also a noted children&#x2019;s book author, and has received five Council of Authors and Journalists Awards. She lives in Carmel, California, where she serves as full-time household help to two demanding feline ladies.</p>Rousseau&#39;s uneven 19th Joe Grey Mystery (after 2012&#39;s Cat Bearing Gifts) finds talking tomcat PI Joe Grey, and his pregnant partner, Dulcie, investigating a string of assaults in Molena Point, Calif. Most assume the attacks are cruel pranks, as the initial victims are all elderly and any serious injuries appear incidental. However, when a healthy young carpenter is killed, the villagers begin to fear something more sinister is afoot. Cat fans will love Murphy&#39;s complex and intelligent feline characters and the special relationships they share with their human housemates. Readers in search of a fair-play mystery may be left wanting, though, as the whodunit portion of the tale takes a backseat to the imminent death of terminally ill cat Misto and the impending birth of Joe and Dulcie&#39;s kittens. The duo&#39;s detecting skills are sharp, but suspects and clues are scarce, and the killer&#39;s motivation feels tacked on. A tonally jarring subplot involving the journey of fellow cats Kit and Pan to a land populated with unicorns, elves, and dragons feels digressive and further muddies the main story line.

ICR geologist Dr. John Morris and zoologist Frank Sherwin unearth the evidence of earth&#39;s history and conclude that the fossil record is incompatible with evolution, but remarkably consistent with the biblical account of creation and the great Flood of Noah&#39;s day.</p><p>About the Authors: Dr. John D. Morris PHD, perhaps best known for leading expeditions to Mt. Ararat in search of Noah's Ark, received his Doctorate in Geological Engineering at the University of Oklahoma in 1980. He served on the University of Oklahoma faculty before joining the Institute for Creation Research in 1984. Dr. Morris held the position of Professor of Geology and was appointed President in 1996. He continues to serve ICR as President Emeritus. He traveled widely around the world speaking at churches, conferences, schools, and scientific meetings. Dr. Morris has written numerous books and articles on the scientific evidence that supports the Bible. Dr. Morris is the author or co-author of such books as The Young Earth, The Modern Creation Trilogy, The Fossil Record: Unearthing Nature's History of Life, The Global Flood: Unlocking Earth's Geologic History, and Noah's Ark: Adventures on Ararat. He is also a contributor to Guide to Creation Basics and Creation Basics &amp; Beyond. Frank Sherwin received his bachelor's degree in biology from Western State College, Gunnison, Colorado, in 1978. He attended graduate school at the University of Northern Colorado, where he studied under the late Gerald D. Schmidt, one of the foremost parasitologists in America. In 1985, Mr. Sherwin obtained a master's degree in zoology. He published his research in the peer-reviewed Journal of Parasitology. He contributes his scientific expertise to a variety of ICR's publications on creation science and is one of ICR's most sought-after speakers. He is the author of The Ocean Book and Guide to Animals, co-author of The Fossil Record: Unearthing Nature's History of Life and The Human Body: An Intelligent Design, and a contributor to Guide to Creation Basics and Creation Basics &amp; Beyond.I really like this book and enjoy sharing it with others. It is full of scientific study, research, facts, and proofs that are presented in a simple strait forward manner that is easy to read and understand. Geologist Dr. John Morris and zoologist Frank Sherwin examine the fossil record and have found that the fossil record simply does not fit the Theory of Evolution. The fossil record very logically and scientifically invalidates the evolutionist s ideas. The fossil record does however fit and support the Biblical Genesis creation event. The Fossil Record is a great Home School resource. The Fossil Record can be used by homeschoolers as early as the 4th grade and is still effective for senior high. The Fossil Record is also an excellent Sunday school and Bible study reference for upper elementary, mid and senior high youth as well as adults classes. The Fossil Record gives solid fossil and geological evidence that the Theory of Evolution and the billions of years old, age of the earth are wrong. --Jan Greve Pastor&#39;s Wife, Retired Children&#39;s Christian education Director, Bible Study Fellowship Leader, Stephen Ministry Leader.</p><h2>Lyon&#39;s Pride (Rowan , Bk. 4)</h2><p>Rowan, her daughter and son-in-law, Damia and Afra, and their children must use their extraordinary telepathic abilities to battle the alien Hivers in outer space.</p><p>The extraordinary saga of the Rowan, Damia, and their unforgettable families continues!<p>The beautiful woman called The Rowan was the most powerful telepath of the Alliance-until the birth of her daughter, Damia.

With expert advice, color photos, drawings, and exploded diagrams, Popular Mechanics reveals exactly what this all-important piece of equipment can do. This invaluable and instructive manual covers it all: cutting wood to precise dimension; making simple joints such as grooves, dadoes, rabbets, and miters; crafting jigs and fixtures; and doing advanced techniques, from molding to resawing. It even provides a visual "anatomy" of the many types of available table saws, along with guidance on maintenance and troubleshooting.

For the two faiths which hold it sacred, it is the bedrock of their religion, a singular authority on what to believe and how to live. For non-believers too, it has a commanding status: it is one of the great works of world literature, woven to an unparalleled degree into our language and thought. This book tells the story of the Bible, explaining how it came to be constructed and how it has been understood, from its remote beginnings down to the present. John Barton describes how the narratives, laws, proverbs, prophecies, poems and letters which comprise the Bible were written and when, what we know - and what we cannot know - about their authors and what they might have meant, as well as how these extraordinarily disparate writings relate to each other. His incisive readings shed new light on even the most familiar passages, exposing not only the sources and traditions behind them, but also the busy hands of the scribes and editors who assembled and reshaped them. Untangling the process by which some texts which were regarded as holy, became canonical and were included, and others didn&#39;&#39;t, Barton demonstrates that the Bible is not the fixed text it is often perceived to be, but the result of a long and intriguing evolution. Tracing its dissemination, translation and interpretation in Judaism and Christianity from Antiquity to the rise of modern biblical scholarship, Barton elucidates how meaning has both been drawn from the Bible and imposed upon it. Part of the book&#39;&#39;s originality is to illuminate the gap between religion and scripture, the ways in which neither maps exactly onto the other, and how religious thinkers from Augustine to Luther and Spinoza have reckoned with this. Barton shows that if we are to regard the Bible as &#39;&#39;authoritative&#39;&#39;, it cannot be as believers have so often done in the past.</p><p></p><h2>Massacre at Camp Grant: Forgetting and Remembering Apache History</h2><p><b>Winner of a National Council on Public History Book Award</b><br><br> On April 30, 1871, an unlikely group of Anglo-Americans, Mexican Americans, and Tohono O&#x2019;odham Indians massacred more than a hundred Apache men, women, and children who had surrendered to the U.S. Army at Camp Grant, near Tucson, Arizona. Thirty or more Apache children were stolen and either kept in Tucson homes or sold into slavery in Mexico. Planned and perpetrated by some of the most prominent men in Arizona&#x2019;s territorial era, this organized slaughter has become a kind of &#x201c;phantom history&#x201d; lurking beneath the Southwest&#x2019;s official history, strangely present and absent at the same time.<br><br> Seeking to uncover the mislaid past, this powerful book begins by listening to those voices in the historical record that have long been silenced and disregarded. <i>Massacre at Camp Grant</i> fashions a multivocal narrative, interweaving the documentary record, Apache narratives, historical texts, and ethnographic research to provide new insights into the atrocity. Thus drawing from a range of sources, it demonstrates the ways in which painful histories continue to live on in the collective memories of the communities in which they occurred.<br><br> Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh begins with the premise that every account of the past is suffused with cultural, historical, and political characteristics. By paying attention to all of these aspects of a contested event, he provides a nuanced interpretation of the cultural forces behind the massacre, illuminates how history becomes an instrument of politics, and contemplates why we must study events we might prefer to forget.</p><p>Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh, born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, received his BA in anthropology from the University of Arizona in 1996 and his doctorate in anthropology from Indiana University in 2004. He is the author of <i>History is in the Land: Multivocal Tribal Traditions in Arizona&#x2019;s San Pedro Valley</i> (with T. J. Ferguson) and co-editor of <i>Archaeological Ethics</i> (with Karen D. Vitelli). He has also published in numerous journals, including <i>American Anthropologist</i>, <i>American Indian Quarterly</i>, <i>History and Anthropology</i>, <i>Journal of Social Archaeology</i>, <i>Kiva</i>, and <i>Journal of the Southwest</i>. Dr. Colwell-Chanthaphonh wrote this book as a Fellow at the Center for Desert Archaeology in Tucson and later as a Visiting Scholar at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is now the Project Director at Anthropological Research, LLC.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not easy to write two books in one, but Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh has done so. <i>Massacre at Camp Grant</i> thoroughly addresses both the history of the 1871 massacre and the construction of memory surrounding the event. . . . Colwell-Chanthaphonh elevates the event to the level of academic discussion, where it rightly belongs.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Western Historical Quarterly</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A book about the politics of memory . . . this stands as an important work. . . . The book incorporates disparate viewpoints in reconstructing the West&#x2019;s history of violence.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Pacific Historical Review</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Remarkable. . . . By listening to the words of those who remembered, and then contrasting their accounts with the versions written through the years by non-Indians, the author analyzes and interpets with such clarity that the disparity between the two is sharp and revealing. . . . [This is] an authoritative work that enlarges, enhances, and in many instances supersedes the body of information already available on the tragedy at Aravaipa Creek.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Journal of Arizona History</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Colwell-Chanthaphonh has shed considerable light on a tragedy accorded little notice, but which remains all too real to present-day descendants.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Southwestern Historical Quarterly</i></p><h2>The Grammar Ace: Student Workbook</h2><p>Note: This is the Student Workbook, to be used along with the Instructor's Manual.

She has gained the respect of the men inside the World Wrestling Federation, and the world at large. She was the first woman to wear the Intercontinental Championship belt, yet these were not her most significant battles.</p><p>She has battled her entire life: against a controlling mother; against a scheming father; and against a world with a predetermined view of what beauty and success should be. She has battled and won her entire life.</p><p>If they only knew offers a rare glimpse behind the scenes of the World Wrestling Federation, and a rarer glimpse of what it takes just to get there -- the hurdles that must be overcome... and the broken hearts and broken body parts that are suffered along the way.</p><p>Chyna -- a.k.a. Joanie Laurer -- lets us in what it's like to live your dream and overcome your nightmares. Complete with insights from other WWF Superstars, this is a must read for any fan of the WWF and for anyone who wants to see how a real-life hero overcame adversity.</p></p><p><p> Chyna made history in 1999 by becoming the first female to win the World Wrestling Federation Intercontinental Championship belt. She has appeared on 3rd Rock from the Sun and Mad TV, and recently encouraged young to "Smackdown the Vote" at the Democratic National Convention. This is her first book.</p>With its beguiling blend of swagger and vulnerability, anger and poise, largesse and disgust, Laurer's tell-all tragicomedy will not disappoint her many fans. Sharp-tongued, idiom-slinging and wry, the voice encountered in these pages is both more and less than the Chyna who appears in the wrestling ring. Laurer's painful childhood and adolescence were characterized by her sense of her difference from her peers (taller, more muscular) and punctuated by the antics of her divorced mother and father. She leads us through the tribulations and joys of searching for her niche (belly dancing, selling pagers in inner-city neighborhoods); of getting the proper breast implant size; of changing the role of women in the WWF; of intra-WWF romance; of celebrity. In one memorable scene, while she is fighting for a spot in the WWF, she outdoes pro-wrestler Hunter (who later becomes her boyfriend) in the weight room. In another, terrible moment, her mother and stepfather burst in on her at the doctor's office, livid because her con-artist father had already used their insurance to cover thousands of dollars of his medical bills. As Laurer eloquently demonstrates, her chosen profession makes a fine metaphor for her life. The book successfully maintains Chyna's awe-inspiring, larger-than-life image at the same time that it imparts deeply personal, poignant and inspirational insight into Joanie Laurer. B&amp;w photos. (Jan. 30) Forecast: With her recent Playboy feature, the book's excellent array of photos, Chyna's fan base, a planned author tour and a print run of 300,000 this book should sell big, as have other recent memoirs by wrestling stars.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Ultimate Helm (Spelljammer Cloakmaster Cycle, Book 6)</h2><p>Amid political intrigue, Teldin Moore battle for control of the great ship Spelljammer in the sequel to The Broken Sphere.

The houses around it aren't as lovely as those of Krakow, but they have been charmingly painted and there is a faded graciousness that wins the heart. The plaza came through World War II more or less intact, but the Communist government apparently could not bear the thought of so much wasted space. What use did it have? Public squares were for public demonstrations, and once the Communists had seized control on behalf of the people, public demonstrations would never be needed again. So out in the middle of the square they built a squat, ugly building in a brutally modern style. It sucked the life out of the place. You had to stand with your back to it in order to truly enjoy the square.</p> <p>But we'd all seen the ugly building for so many years that we hardly noticed it anymore, except to apologize to visitors, ruefully remember the bad old days of Communism, and appreciate the irony that the occupants of such a tasteless building should include a restaurant, a bookshop, and an art gallery. And when the plague came and the city was so cruelly and suddenly emptied, those of us who could not let go of Poznan, who could not bear to eke out the last of our lives in the countryside, drifted to the old heart of the city and took up residence in the houses surrounding the square. As time passed, even the ugly building became part of the beauty of the place, for it had been part of the old crowded city now lost forever. Just as the toilets with little altars for the perusal of one's excrement reminded us of the many decades of German overlordship, so this building was also a part of our past, and now, by its sheer persistence among us, a part of ourselves. If we could venerate the bones and other bodily parts of dead saints, couldn't we also find holiness of a kind even in this vile thing? It was a relic of a time when we thought we were suffering, but to which we now would gladly return, just to hear schoolchildren again in the streets, just to see the flower shop once more selling the bright excesses of overcopious nature, spots of vivid color to show us that Poland was not, by nature, grey.</p> <p>Into this square came the elephants, a group of males, making their way in what seemed a relentless silence, except that a trembling of the windows told us that they were speaking to each other in infrasound, low notes that the human ear could not hear, but the human hand could feel on glass. Of course we had all seen elephants for years on our forays out into the gardens of suburban Poznan--clans of females and their children following a matriarch, gangs of mature males hanging out to kill time until one of them went into musth and set off in search of the nearest estrous female. We speculated at first about where they came from, whether their forebears had escaped from a zoo or a circus during the plague. But soon we realized that their numbers were far too great to be accounted for that way. Too many different clans had been seen. On Radio Day we learned, from those few stations that still bothered, that the elephants had come down the Nile, swum the Suez, swarmed through Palestine and Syria and Armenia, crossed the Caucasus, and now fed in the lush wheat pastures of Ukraine, bathed in the streams of Belarus, and stood trumpeting on the shores of Estonia and Pomerania, calling out to some god of the sea, demanding passage to lands as yet unpossessed by the great stumpy feet, the probing noses, the piercing ivory, and the deep thrumming music of the new rulers of the world.</p> <p>Why should they not rule it? We were only relics ourselves, we who had had the misfortune of surviving the plague. Out of every hundred thousand, only fifty or a hundred had survived. And as we scavenged in the ruins, as we bulldozed earth over the corpses we dragged from the areas where we meant to live, as we struggled to learn how to keep a generator or two running, a truck here and there, the radios we used only once a week, then once a month, then once a year, we gradually came to realize that there would be no more children. No one conceived. No one bore. The disease had sterilized us, almost all. There would be no recovery from this plague. Our extinction had not required a celestial missile to shatter the earth and darken the sky for a year; no other species shared our doom with us. We had been taken out surgically, precisely, thoroughly, a tumor removed with a delicate viral hand.</p> <p>So we did not begrudge the elephants their possession of the fields and the forests. The males could knock down trees to show their strength; there was no owner to demand that animal control officers come and dispose of the rampaging beasts. The females could gather their children into barns and stables against the winter blast, and no owner would evict them; only the crumbling bones and strands of hairy flesh showed where horses and cattle had starved to death when their masters died too quickly to think of setting them free from their stalls and pens.</p> <p>Why, though, had these males come into the city? There was nothing for them to eat. There was nothing for us to eat; when our bicycles gave out and we could cobble together no more makeshift carts, we would have to leave the city ourselves and live closer to the food that we gathered from untended fields. Why would the elephants bother with such a ruin? Curiosity, perhaps. Soon they would see that there was nothing here for them, and move on.</p> <p>We found ourselves growing impatient as the hours passed, and the days, and still we kept encountering them on the city streets. Didn't they understand that we lived in the heart of Poznan specifically because we wanted a human place? Didn't they feel our resentment of their trespass? All the rest of Earth is yours; can you not leave undesecrated these crypts we built for ourselves in the days of our glory?</p> <p>Gradually it dawned on us--dawned on me, actually, but the others realized I was right--that the elephants had come not to explore Poznan, but to observe us. I would pedal my bicycle and glance down a cross street to see an elephant lumbering along on a parallel path; I would turn, and see him behind me, and feel that shuddering in my breastbone, in my forehead, that told me they were speaking to each other, and soon another elephant would be shadowing me, seeing where I went, watching what I did, following me home.</p> <p>Why were they interested in us? Humans were no longer killing them for their ivory. The world was theirs. We were going to die--I, who was only seven years old when the plague came, am now past thirty, and many of the older survivors are already, if not at death's door, then studying the travel brochures and making reservations, their Bibles open and their rosaries in hand. Were these males here as scientists, to watch the last of the humans, to study our deathways, to record the moment of our extinction so that the elephants would remember how we died with only a whimper, or less than that, a whisper, a sigh, a sidelong glance at God?</p> <p>I had to know. For myself, for my own satisfaction. If I found the truth, whom else would I tell it to, and for what purpose? they would only die as I would die, taking memory with them into the fire, into the ash, into the dust. I couldn't get any of the others to care about the questions that preyed upon me. What do the elephants want from us? Why do they follow us?</p> <p>Leave it alone, Lukasz, they said to me. Isn't it enough that they don't bother us?</p> <p>And I answered with the most perplexing question of all, to me at least. Why elephants? The other wild animals that roamed the open country were the ones one might expect to see: the packs of dogs gone wild, interbreeding back to mongrel wolfhood; the herds of cattle, breeding back to hardiness; and of horses, quick and free and uninterested in being tamed. The companions of man, the servants and slaves of man, now masterless, now free. Unshorn sheep. Unmilked goats. Sudden-leaping housecats. Scrawny wild chickens hiding from ever-vigilant hawks. Ill-tempered pigs rooting in the woods, the boars making short work of dogs that grew too bold. That was the wildlife of Europe. No other animals from Africa had made the journey north. Only the elephants, and not just from Africa--the elephants of India were roaming the orient, and on the most recent Radio Day we learned, through messages relayed many times, that they had somehow crossed the Bering Strait and were now, in ever greater numbers, grazing the prairies of America, small-eared cousins to the great-canopied beasts that now shadowed us on the streets of Poznan. I pictured them swimming, or piling onto boats that some last human pilot guided for them onto the stygian shore.</p> <p>They had inherited the Earth, and were bent on surveying their new domain.</p> <p>So I took to spending my days in the library, reading all I could about elephants, and then about all the processes of life, all the passages of history, trying to understand not only them but ourselves, and what had happened to us, and what our cities might mean to them, our houses, our streets, our rusting cars, our collapsing bridges, our sorry cemetery mounds where winter brought fresh crops of human bone to the surface, white stubble on a fallow field. I write this now because I think I know the answers, or at least have found guesses that ring true to me, though I also know they might be nothing more than a man hungry for meanings inventing them where they don't exist. Arguably, all meanings are invented anyway; and since I have no one to please but myself, and no one to read this who will care, except perhaps one, then I may write as I please, and think as I please, and reread this whenever I can bear it.</p> <p>They made no effort to follow me inside the library. What good would it do them? Clever as they were with their inquisitive trunks, I could imagine them being deft enough to turn pages without tearing them. But what would the markings on the pages mean to them? Elephants sang their literature to each other in octaves we humans could not hear. Their science was the science of the temporal gland, the probing nose. They observed, but--or so I thought--did not experiment.</p> <p>I did learn enough to warn the others before the first of the males went into musth. When you see one of them acting agitated, when his temporal glands pour out a steady black streak down his cheeks, when the other males are shy of him and give him room, then we must do the same, staying out of his way, not meeting his gaze. Let him pass. The city is his, wherever he wants to go. He won't stay here long, in musth. He must go and find a female then, and they were all outside in the open fields. He would give his deep rumbling call and pour out his lusty scent into the air and dribble musky fluid onto the ground where every other elephant could smell it and know: This way passed a male bent on making babies. This way passed God, looking for the Holy Virgin.</p> <p>So we studied each other, and avoided offending each other, and grew used to each other's ways, the elephants and the fifty remaining residents of Poznan.</p> <p>And then one day they began to push.</p> <p>The males all gathered in the public square. We, too, gossiping to each other that something important was going to happen, gathered in our houses and leaned at our windows to watch.</p> <p>They wandered aimlessly through the square, eleven of them--the twelve apostles, I thought, sans Iscariot--until noon made the smallest shadows. Then, as if of one mind, they surrounded the ugly old Communist building, facing it. When all were in place, they moved forward, slowly, each bull resting his massive brow against the miserable fa�ade. Then, slowly, each began to tense his muscles, to shift his weight, to make little adjustments, to plant his feet, and then to push with greater and greater strength against the wall.</p> <p>They're trying to push it down, I realized. And so did the others, all of us calling out to each other in our high-pitched human voices.</p> <p>They're critics of architecture!</p> <p>They've come to beautify Poznan!</p> <p>We began to address the elephants with our calls, as if they were our football team, as if the plaza were a playing field. We cheered them, laughed in approval, shouted encouragement, placed meaningless bets about whether they could actually break through the walls.</p> <p>Then, abruptly, I was no longer part of the playfulness. For without meaning to, I changed perspective suddenly, and saw us as the elephants must have seen us. This was Africa after all, and we were the primates perched in the trees, hooting and screeching at the giants, unaware of our own insignificance, or at least unbothered by it.</p> <p>When I pulled my head back inside my window, I was filled with grief, though at that moment I could not have told you why. I thought at first it was because we humans were so diminished, reduced to chattering from safe perches. But then I realized that the human race had always been the same, had never risen, really, from our primate ways. No, what I was grieving for was that ugly old building, that relic of noble dreams gone sour. I had never lived under Communism, had only heard the stories of the Russian overlords and the Polish Communists who claimed to be fulfilling the will of the masses and perhaps, sometimes, believed their own propaganda--so my father told me, and I had no reason to doubt him. When the Communists decided what was good and what was bad, they acted as rigidly as any Puritan. Aesthetic concerns in architecture led to wasteful overspending of the labor of the working class; therefore, the ugliness of all new buildings was a badge of virtue. We human beings had reinvented ourselves, Homo sovieticus, Homo coprofabricus, or whatever the scientific name would be. A new species that never guessed how quickly it would be extinct.</p> <p>The elephants would keep pushing until the walls came down--I knew that. Intransigence was built into the elephants' shoulders the way screeching and chattering were built into the primate mouth. And even though the other humans were cheering them, egging them on, I was sad. No, wistful. If we had really wanted that ugly building taken down, we knew where the dynamite was kept, we could have blown it out of existence. Elephants are mighty and strong, as beasts go, but when it comes to destruction, their foreheads are no match for the explosives in the locked sheds at the construction sites of buildings that will never be finished.</p> <p>We don't need you to take it down, you meddlers, I wanted to say. We built it, we humans. It's ours. What right have you to decide which artifacts should stand, and which should fall?</p> <p>The fascination of it was irresistible, though. I couldn't stay away from the window for long. I had to check, again, again, to see if they were making any progress, to see if some crack had appeared. The beasts had enormous patience, pushing and pushing until their shadows were swallowed up in the shade of the buildings as the sun headed out past Germany, past France, out to the Atlantic to be plunged steaming into the sea of night. That was the clock they lived by, these elephants; they had put in their day's work, and now they wandered off, heading out of the city as they did most nights, to eat and drink and sleep in some more hospitable place.</p> <p>The next morning they were back, earlier this time, and formed their circle much more quickly, and pushed again. The betting among us began in earnest, then. Would they succeed? Would they give up? How long till the first crack? How long till a wall fell? We had nothing of value to bet; or rather, we had everything,...</p></p><h2>The Myths of Human Evolution</h2><p>Examines the mechanism of evolution, criticizes the theory of constant adaptive change in terms of gaps in the fossil record, and looks at the evolution of humans</p><p></p><h2>Phantom Prey</h2><p>Editorial Reviews From Publishers Weekly In bestseller Sandford&#39;s solid 18th Prey novel (after Invisible Prey), Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agent Lucas Davenport, who&#39;s received numerous promotions in the course of the series, ought to be taking the desk aspects of his job more seriously.

Celebrate the hundred-year anniversary of one of the most beloved toys of the 20th-century: the timeless Lionel train. Other playthings have left their mark on the pages of American history and some still evoke a misty-eyed nostalgia, but no toy has had as dramatic an impact as these miniature cars, tracks, and accessories. Their magic makes children wide-eyed with joy at Christmas and continues to inspire collectors of all ages. Enjoy the history of Lionel's rise to greatness in a splendid oversize tribute, featuring breathtaking images of perfectly preserved trains from every era, including some of the most famous and rare models, as well as reproductions of legendary catalogs and ads. A wealth of enlightening detail about individual pieces puts them in their proper place in the total Lionel output. The definitive tribute to a most cherished American institution. <br></p><p>This attractive, oversized book blends striking color photos with a history of the production of Lionel trains. For toy train enthusiasts, the photos will be the most interesting facet of the book. Most illustrated books of collectible toy trains are fairly straightforward, with endless pictures of locomotives and cars viewed side-on to show what they really look like. By contrast, commercial photographer Milne has produced almost impressionistic photographs. They feature selected details, limited depth of field, dramatic lighting, unusual angles, and train layout backgrounds. Given the large page size and high-quality paper, the pictures are particularly attractive. Fun to read, the text by dealer and collector Ponzol covers very familiar territory, but with the addition of comments on the interrelationships between the toys and their times. It also has occasional errors, and it's sometimes uncritically enthusiastic, perhaps reflecting the role of the current Lionel company in the packaging of the book. Still, Lionel trains have a wide nostalgic and collector appeal, and Lionel should therefore have a large public library audience. Frederick A.

These caravans were masterpieces of woodcraft and design, and the best of them cost as much as a small house. Unlike any small house, almost half the cost was in the decoration.This beautifully illustrated book presents the different types of caravan and the great variety of art which was carved and painted upon them and their brothers-in-transport, the old narrowboats. While there were certain rules and conventions of style, the decoration on and in all the types was ultimately governed only by how much money could be spent. The caravan in particular was the supreme status symbol among travelling people and its art the prime means for expressing where one stood in the world.</p><p>Photographer John Baxter was the winner of &#39;Best Image&#39; in the SUN Awards, for commercial photographers in the North of England, in 2007.

First serial Rolling Stone.</p><p>Wexler's account of how he talked his way into co-ownership of Atlantic Records and went on to produce some of the century's great pop music--all of which makes for some of the juiciest music history one could hope to find. As an insider's account of the golden age of rhythm and blues (a term Wexler coined), this memoir may be matched only by Atlantic founder Ahmet Ertegun's--if he chooses to write one. By turns regretful and boasting, Wexler offers a story that is above all a superlative read, with the sections describing his 1920's-30's Manhattan childhood as interesting as the more musically oriented later chapters. With help from Ritz (who's written bios of Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye), Wexler describes his years at Billboard magazine, his move to Atlantic, and his relationships with the Chess brothers, Alan Freed, Phil Spector, and many others. Colorfully colloquial and unflaggingly enthusiastic, Wexler makes important connections between various styles and artists--noting the influence of the blues, for example, on country balladeers--and shows what a complex cultural phenomenon the best pop has always been. Accounts of how he managed recording sessions with everyone from Ray Charles to Aretha Franklin to Bob Dylan reveal much about both music history and making. Although testimony from ex-wives, friends, and (surprisingly) enemies isn't always well integrated, and though some readers will be less sympathetic to the author's temper and excesses, Wexler's contribution to the music is unquestionable, and there's plenty of material here that only he could provide. Many anecdotes--including an amazing account of a recording date with Guitar Slim--may pass into legend. It's a shame no CD set was issued with the book. For scholars and R&amp;B/pop aficianodos, a terrific read--in spite of and because of its idiosyncracies--and great fun for others as well. (Seventy-five photographs--not seen) (First serial to Rolling Stone) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Veteran record producer Wexler, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member who coined the term "rhythm and blues," spent the Depression as an adolescent in the Washington Heights section of New York City, hanging out in pool halls, hunting for rare records, hungering for excitement. Wexler took journalism courses at a college in Kansas but spent years as a window washer in Manhattan. After a stint in the wartime Army, he joined the staff of Billboard. In 1952 he became a partner in Ahmed Ertegun's Atlantic Records, recording such jazz, blues and folk greats as Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Solomon Burke, Joe Turner, Betty Carter, the Drifters, Etta James and Bob Dylan. This spirited memoir, written with freelancer Ritz, crackles with career highlights and swings breezily through five decades of record-making, focusing especially on the 1950s and 1960s. Readers will enjoy accounts of Wexler's seminal encounters with gifted musicians, but they may wish for deeper development of this hip-merchant's life story.

Yet at the same time the law created the means to escape that relationship. How was this possible? And how did wives and husbands experience marriage within that legal regime? These are the complexities that Hendrik Hartog plumbs in a study of the powers of law and its limits. </p><p> Exploring a century and a half of marriage through stories of struggle and conflict mined from case records, Hartog shatters the myth of a golden age of stable marriage. He describes the myriad ways the law shaped and defined marital relations and spousal identities, and how individuals manipulated and reshaped the rules of the American states to fit their needs. We witness a compelling cast of characters: wives who attempted to leave abusive husbands, women who manipulated their marital status for personal advantage, accidental and intentional bigamists, men who killed their wives' lovers, couples who insisted on divorce in a legal culture that denied them that right. </p><p> As we watch and listen to these men and women, enmeshed in law and escaping from marriages, we catch reflected images both of ourselves and our parents, of our desires and our anxieties about marriage. Hartog shows how our own conflicts and confusions about marital roles and identities are rooted in the history of marriage and the legal struggles that defined and transformed it. </p></p><p><b>Hendrik Hartog</b> is Class of 1921 Bicentennial Professor of the History of American Law and Liberty at Princeton University.Hendrik Hartog offers a revealing history of marital and legal struggles.

(Felice Batlan <i>H-Net Reviews</i>)<br><br>Hartog, a history and law professor, examines the most basic social institution from a legal standpoint. He reviews important, precedent-setting cases that have formed American law on marriage and also examines the social context that produced the laws...Hartog charts the changes in law from the time when a woman's legal identity derived from her husband to no-fault divorces and economic and social (e.g., feminism) trends in this interesting look at the legal institution of marriage.

Through fascinating tales about men and women whose failed marriages led them to the law, he makes a major contribution to our understanding of American culture, past and present. <i>Man and Wife in America</i> is a compelling and important achievement that deserves a wide readership. (Michael Grossberg, Editor <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>Henrik Hartog's book is particularly relevant in an era when debate over gay marriage is front-page news. The issues raised by this debate--the rights, responsibilities, and expectations of what marriage is and can do for individuals as well as constraints imposed by the marriage contract- are at the heart of the book, even though it is focused on traditional male/female marriages from the late eighteenth century to the 1950s...The volume is a very readable, well-written addition to the literature on legal history, family history, and women's history. Hartog's emphasis on the social and cultural context of changing marriage law is refreshing whether one agrees that women frequently benefited from coverture (sic) and traditional notions about marriage or not...[T]his book will bring the legal history of marriage to a larger audience of non-specialist academics and students.

For Hartog, however, both the boundlessness and vastness are part of his method. His frank denial of system in his scholarship with its echoes of postmodernism coincides nicely with one of his principle points: the untidy and indeterminate nature of American marriage law...Hartog's effort to recast the story of marriage law by underscoring its exceptions and complications is both interesting and important and is rendered with verve and imagination. The book is provocative and engaging; it should attract students as well as scholars; and it should become an integral part of scholarly discourse on Anglo-American marriage law and its long and controversial history. (Norma Basch <i>Reviews in American History</i>)<br><br>By locating and exploring the legal boundaries of marital behavior, however, Hartog is also able to say much about the social and economic context of marriage...Further, Hartog writes with great clarity and directness.

In this semiautobiographical coming-of-age novel, thirteen-year-old Joel Knox, after losing his mother, is sent from New Orleans to live with the father who abandoned him at birth. But when Joel arrives at Skully&#39;s Landing, the decaying mansion in rural Alabama, his father is nowhere to be found. Instead, Joel meets his morose stepmother, Amy, eccentric Cousin Randolph, and a defiant little girl named Idabel, who soon offers Joel the love and approval he seeks.</p><p>TRUMAN CAPOTE was born September 30, 1924, in New Orleans. After his parents&#x2019; divorce, he was sent to live with relatives in Monroeville, Alabama. It was here he would meet his lifelong friend, the author Harper Lee. With the 1948 publication of <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms,</i> Capote was catapulted onto the international literary scene and for nearly four decades was a fixture in New York literati and high society circles. Twice awarded the O. Henry Short Story Prize, Capote was also the recipient of a National Institute of Arts and Letters Creative Writing Award and an Edgar Award. Among his many celebrated works are the short-story collection <i>The Grass Harp</i>, the novella <i>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s</i>, the memoirs <i>A Christmas Memory</i> and <i>The Thanksgiving Visitor</i>, and the true-crime masterpiece <i>In Cold Blood</i>. Capote died in 1984, just weeks shy of his sixtieth birthday. <br><br>JOHN BERENDT is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>. His work has also appeared in <i>Esquire</i> and <i>New York</i>, where he was also an editor. He lives in New York City.One<br><br> Now a traveler must make his way to Noon City by the best means he can, for there are no buses or trains heading in that direction, though six days a week a truck from the Chuberry Turpentine Company collects mail and supplies in the next-door town of Paradise Chapel: occasionally a person bound for Noon City can catch a ride with the driver of the truck, Sam Radclif. It&#x2019;s a rough trip no matter how you come, for these washboard roads will loosen up even brandnew cars pretty fast; and hitchhikers always find the going bad. Also, this is lonesome country; and here in the swamplike hollows where tiger lilies bloom the size of a man&#x2019;s head, there are luminous green logs that shine under the dark marsh water like drowned corpses; often the only movement on the landscape is winter smoke winding out the chimney of some sorry-looking farmhouse, or a wing-stiffened bird, silent and arrow-eyed, circling over the black deserted pinewoods.<br><br>Two roads pass over the hinterlands into Noon City; one from the north, another from the south; the latter, known as the Paradise Chapel Highway, is the better of the pair, though both are much the same: desolate miles of swamp and field and forest stretch along either route, unbroken except for scattered signs advertising Red Dot 5� Cigars, Dr. Pepper, NEHI, Grove&#x2019;s Chill Tonic, and 666. Wooden bridges spanning brackish creeks named for long-gone Indian tribes rumble like far-off thunder under a passing wheel; herds of hogs and cows roam the roads at will; now and then a farm-family pauses from work to wave as an auto whizzes by, and watch sadly till it disappears in red dust.<br><br>One sizzling day in early June the Turpentine Company&#x2019;s driver, Sam Radclif, a big balding six-footer with a rough, manly face, was gulping a beer at the Morning Star Caf� in Paradise Chapel when the proprietor came over with his arm around this stranger-boy.<br><br>&#x201c;Hiya, Sam,&#x201d; said the proprietor, a fellow called Sydney Katz. &#x201c;Got a kid here that&#x2019;d be obliged if you could give him a ride to Noon City. Been trying to get there since yesterday. Think you can help?&#x201d;<br><br>Radclif eyed the boy over the rim of his beer glass, not caring much for the looks of him. He had his notions of what a &#x201c;real&#x201d; boy should look like, and this kid somehow offended them. He was too pretty, too delicate and fair-skinned; each of his features was shaped with a sensitive accuracy, and a girlish tenderness softened his eyes, which were brown and very large. His brown hair, cut short, was streaked with pure yellow strands. A kind of tired, imploring expression masked his thin face, and there was an unyouthful sag about his shoulders. He wore long, wrinkled white linen breeches, a limp blue shirt, the collar of which was open at the throat, and rather scuffed tan shoes.<br><br>Wiping a mustache of foam off his upper lips, Radclif said: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s you name, son?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Joel. Jo-el Har-ri-son Knox.&#x201d; He separated the syllables explicitly, as though he thought the driver deaf, but his voice was uncommonly soft.<br><br>&#x201c;That so?&#x201d; drawled Radclif, placing his dry beer glass on the counter. &#x201c;A mighty fancy name, Mister Knox.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy blushed and turned to the proprietor, who promptly intervened: &#x201c;This is a fine boy, Sam. Smart as a whip. Knows words you and me never heard of.&#x201d;<br><br>Radclif was annoyed. &#x201c;Here, Katz,&#x201d; he ordered, &#x201c;fillerup.&#x201d; After the proprietor trundled away to fetch a second beer, Sam said kindly, &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t mean to tease you, son. Where bouts you from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;New Orleans,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I left there Thursday and got here Friday . . . and that was as far as I could go; no one come to meet me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah,&#x201d; said Radclif. &#x201c;Visiting folks in Noon City?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy nodded. &#x201c;My father. I&#x2019;m going to live with him.&#x201d;<br><br>Radclif raised his eyes ceilingward, mumbled &#x201c;Knox&#x201d; several times, then shook his head in a baffled manner. &#x201c;Nope, don&#x2019;t think I know anybody by that name. Sure you&#x2019;re in the right place?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes,&#x201d; said the boy without alarm. &#x201c;Ask Mister Katz, he&#x2019;s heard about my father, and I showed him the letters and . . . wait.&#x201d; He hurried back among the tables of the gloomy caf�, and returned toting a huge tin suitcase that, judging by his grimace, was extremely heavy. The suitcase was colorful with faded souvenir stickers from remote parts of the globe: Paris, Cairo, Venice, Vienna, Naples, Hamburg, Bombay, and so forth. It was an odd thing to see on a hot day in a town the size of Paradise Chapel.<br><br>&#x201c;You been all them places?&#x201d; asked Radclif.<br><br>&#x201c;No-o-o,&#x201d; said the boy, struggling to undo a worn-out leather strap which held the suitcase together. &#x201c;It belonged to my grandfather; that was Major Knox: you&#x2019;ve read about him in history books, I guess. He was a prominent figure in the Civil War. Anyway, this is the valise he used on his wedding trip around the world.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Round the world, eh?&#x201d; said Radclif, impressed. &#x201c;Musta been a mighty rich man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that was a long time ago.&#x201d; He rummaged through his neatly packed possessions till he found a slim package of letters. &#x201c;Here it is,&#x201d; he said, selecting one in a watergreen envelope.<br><br>Radclif fingered the letter a moment before opening it; but presently, with clumsy care, he extracted a green sheet of tissue-like paper and, moving his lips, read:<br><br>Edw. R. Sansom, Esq. Skully&#x2019;s Landing May 18, 19&#x2014;<br><br>My dear Ellen Kendall,<br><br>I am in your debt for answering my letter so quickly; indeed, by return post. Yes, hearing from me after twelve years must have seemed strange, but I can assure you sufficient reason prompted this long silence. However, reading in the Times-Picayune, to the Sunday issue of which we subscribe, of my late wife&#x2019;s passing, may God the Almighty rest her gentle soul, I at once reasoned the honorable thing could only be to again assume my paternal duties, forsaken, lo, these many years. Both the present Mrs Sansom and myself are happy (nay, overjoyed!) to learn you are willing to concede our desire, though, as you remark, your heart will break in doing so. Ah, how well I sympathize with the sorrow such a sacrifice may bring, having experienced similar emotions when, after that final dreadful affair, I was forced to take leave of my only child, whom I treasured, while he was still no more than an infant. But that is all of the lost past. Rest assured, good lady, we here at the Landing have a beautiful home, healthful food, and a cultured atmosphere with which to provide my son.<br><br>As to the journey: we are anxious Joel reach here no later than June First. Now when he leaves New Orleans he should travel via train to Biloxi, at which point he must disembark and purchase a bus ticket for Paradise Chapel, a town some twenty miles south of Noon City. We have at present no mechanical vehicle; therefore, I suggest he remain overnight in P.C. where rooms are let above the Morning Star Caf�, until appropriate arrangements can be made. Enclosed please find a cheque covering such expenses as all this may incur.<br><br>Yrs. Respct. Edw. R. Sansom<br><br>The proprietor arrived with the beer just as Radclif, frowning puzzledly, sighed and tucked the paper back in its envelope. There were two things about this letter that bothered him; first of all, the handwriting: penned in ink the rusty color of dried blood, it was a maze of curlicues and dainty i&#x2019;s dotted with daintier o&#x2019;s. What the hell kind of a man would write like that? And secondly: &#x201c;If your Pa&#x2019;s named Sansom, how come you call yourself Knox?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy stared at the floor embarrassedly. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, and shot Radclif a swift, accusing look, as if the driver was robbing him of something, &#x201c;they were divorced, and mother always called me Joel Knox.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aw, say, son,&#x201d; said Radclif, &#x201c;you oughtn&#x2019;t to have let her done that! Remember, your Pa&#x2019;s your Pa no matter what.&#x201d;<br><br>The proprietor avoided a yearning glance for help which the boy now cast in his direction by having wandered off to attend another customer. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve never seen him,&#x201d; said Joel, dropping the letters into his suitcase and buckling up the strap. &#x201c;Do you know where this place is? Skully&#x2019;s Landing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Landing?&#x201d; Radclif said. &#x201c;Sure, sure I know all about it.&#x201d; He took a deep swallow of beer, let forth a mighty belch, and grinned. &#x201c;Yessir, if I was your Pa I&#x2019;d take down your britches and muss you up a bit.&#x201d; Then, draining the glass, he slapped a half-dollar on the counter, and stood meditatively scratching his hairy chin till a wall clock sounded the hour four: &#x201c;O.K., son, let&#x2019;s shove,&#x201d; he said, starting briskly towards the door.<br><br>After a moment&#x2019;s hesitation the boy lifted his suitcase and followed.<br><br>&#x201c;Come see us again,&#x201d; called the proprietor automatically.</p><h2>Prentice Hall Physical Science: Concepts in Action With Earth and Space Science (Laboratory manual), Annotated Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>The Laboratory Manual contains Teacher&#39;s information and answers for 53 Laboratory Investigations directly related to the information presented in Prentice Hall Physical Science: Concepts in Action.

The collection reflects the view that from whatever age music emanates there is a close link between music, mysticism and magic and as illustration the author includes the spiritual and philosophical dimensions of the work of Plato, Plutarch, Kepler, Balzac, Gurdjieff, Schopenhauer and Stockhausen, Wagner and Schumann - none of these names may appear related but the common ground is shared through music.</p><p></p><h2>New Living Translation New Testament</h2><p>New Living Translation New Testament</p><p></p><h2>Postcards From The Boys: Featuring Postcards Sent By John Lennon, Paul Mccartney, And George Harriso</h2><p>Sensationally presented, this book features 53 postcards sent by John Lennon, George Harrison and Paul McCartney to Ringo Starr. The superb facsimile reproductions complete with the occasional drawing, depict both the spontaneous wit and art of the Beatles. The reproduction of the postcards is supplemented by a revealing text from Ringo explaining the meaning behind the cards and documenting the corresponding moments in his life. This visually stunning and intriguing book is, quite simply, a must-have for anyone interested in the story of the Beatles phenomenon.</p><p>Ringo Starr will always be best known as the drummer with the Beatles, but has spent the years since their break-up involved in a wide variety of projects from music with his various All-Starr bands to acting and children&#39;s television. He is very active on behalf of the Lotus Foundation, which promotes healing through music, poetry and meditation.Ringo loved to receive mail, especially from his band mates. Didn't matter much what the notes said&#x2014;"everything here is still going well, except we miss you," "doing nothing at all" or "YOU ARE THE GREATEST DRUMMER IN THE WORLD"&#x2014;he saved them, and now, 38 years after getting a postcard from Paul from Spain ("not understanding a word but having fun"), he shares them in this intimate, funny and moving collection. The fronts of the cards are displayed on left-hand pages&#x2014;there are Copenhagen rooftops, topless Zulu women, topless Australian scuba divers, Prince Charles, the Statue of Liberty, topless Hawaiian ukulele players&#x2014;while the backs appear on right-hand pages. The notes allow readers into an insider club of sorts, shedding light on the good, the bad and making music, and Ringo offers commentary below each one. For example, after a note from John and Yoko saying, "Who'd have thought it would come to this...." Ringo recalls, "This was a hell time because it was the family break-up." Another card, from Paul, reads, "YOU GOT THAT SOMETHING." Asks Ringo, "What was happening in my life here? Do you know?" Perhaps what these missives best illuminate is the deep friendship that existed among "the boys," despite all that was going on with the Beatles and in the world, proving, perhaps, that all you need is love. 100+ color photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author Tsong-kha-pa (1357&#x2013;1419) completed this masterpiece in 1402 and it soon became one of the most renowned works of spiritual practice and philosophy in the world of Tibetan Buddhism. Tsong-kha-pa took great pains to base his incisive insights on the classical Indian Buddhist literature, illustrating his points with classical citations as well as with sayings of the masters of the earlier Kadampa tradition. In this way, the text demonstrates clearly how Tibetan Buddhism carefully preserved and developed the Indian Buddhist traditions. Volume One covers all practices that are prerequisite for developing the spirit of enlightenment (bodhicitta). Volume Two explains how to train in the six perfections in order to develop the heart of compassion indispensable for any student who wants to put the Dharma into practice. Volume Three contains a presentation of the two most important topics to be found in the Great Treatise: meditative serenity (shamatha) and supramundane insight into the nature of reality (vipasyana).</p><p>"Of the many works of the Tibetan master Tsong-kha-pa, none compare in terms of popularity and breadth of influence with his Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (Lamrim Chenmo), which has been treasured by practitioners and scholars alike for centuries. What distinguishes it as one of the principal texts of Mahayana Buddhism is its scope and clarity. It expounds the entire path from the way one should rely on a spiritual teacher, which is the very root, right up to the attainment of Buddhahood, which is the final fruit. The various stages of the path are presented so clearly and systematically that they can be easily understood and are inspiring to put into practice."--H.H. the Dalai Lama <p>"...one of the greatest religious or secular works in the library of our human heritage."--Prof. Robert A.F.

Theroux first came to Africa as a twenty-two-year-old Peace Corps volunteer, and the pull of the vast land never left him. Now he returns, after fifty years on the road, to explore the little-traveled territory of western Africa and to take stock both of the place and of himself. <br><br>His odyssey takes him northward from Cape Town, through South Africa and Namibia, then on into Angola, wishing to head farther still until he reaches the end of the line. Journeying alone through the greenest continent, Theroux encounters a world increasingly removed from both the itineraries of tourists and the hopes of postcolonial independence movements. Leaving the Cape Town townships, traversing the Namibian bush, passing the browsing cattle of the great sunbaked heartland of the savanna, Theroux crosses &#x201c;the Red Line&#x201d; into a different Africa: &#x201c;the improvised, slapped-together Africa of tumbled fences and cooking fires, of mud and thatch,&#x201d; of heat and poverty, and of roadblocks, mobs, and anarchy.

Barry is brutal in his assessment of the Bush administration(s), all of them. But he doesnt spare the Democrats either. This is a perfect dose of Barrys oddball humor, which is great in small doses, say a couple hundred years at a time. M.S. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>One Spirit Medicine: Ancient Ways to Ultimate Wellness</h2><p>Today our minds, our emotions, our relationships, and our bodies are out of kilter. We know it, but we tend to ignore it until something brings us up short&#x2014;a worrying diagnosis, a broken relationship, or simply an inability to function harmoniously in everyday life. When things are a little off, we read a self-help book. When they&#x2019;re really bad, we bring in oncologists to address cancer, neurologists to repair the brain, psychologists to help us understand our family of origin. But this fragmented approach to health is merely a stopgap. To truly heal, we need to return to the original recipe for wellness discovered by shamans millennia ago: One Spirit Medicine. Through One Spirit Medicine, the shamans found that they could grow a new body that allowed them to live in extraordinary health. They learned how to switch off the "death clock" inside every cell, and turn on the "immortality" genes that reside in password-protected regions of our DNA. Cancer, dementia, and heart disease were rare. The shamans of old were truly masters of prevention. Drawing on more than 25 years of experience as a medical anthropologist&#x2014;as well as his own journey back from the edge of death&#x2014;acclaimed shamanic teacher Alberto Villoldo shows you how to detoxify the brain and gut with superfoods, use techniques for working with our luminous energy fields to heal your body, and follow the ancient path of the medicine wheel to shed disempowering stories from the past and pave the way for rebirth. Using the principles and practices in this book, you can feel better in a few days, begin to clear your mind and heal your brain in a week, and in six weeks be on your way to a new body&#x2014;one that heals rapidly, retains its youthful vitality, and keeps you connected to Spirit, to the earth, and to a renewed sense of purpose in your life.</p><p>Alberto Villoldo, Ph.D., has trained as a psychologist and medical anthropologist, and has studied the healing practices of the Amazon and the Andean shamans. Dr. Villoldo directs The Four Winds Society, where he trains individuals in the U.S. and Europe in the practice of shamanic energy medicine. He is the founder of the Light Body School, which has campuses in New York, California, Miami, and Germany. He directs the Center for Energy Medicine in Chile, where he investigates and practices the neuroscience of enlightenment. Dr. Villoldo has written numerous best-selling books, including Shaman, Healer, Sage; The Four Insights; Courageous Dreaming; and Power Up Your Brain. Website: www.thefourwinds.com&#x201c;<i>One Spirit Medicine</i>is the new manifesto for body and soul. The wisdom of the ancients is being newly discovered in the language of our biology. Alberto Villoldo translates advances in the science of creating health and integrates them with spiritual and life practices from shamanic traditions&#x2014;the one medicine we all need to reclaim body, mind, and soul. There is no one better to guide us on our journey toward living a light-filled, vibrant life.&#x201d;<p>&#x2014; Mark Hyman, M.D., author of #1<i>New York Times </i>bestseller, <i>The Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet, </i>and director, Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine</p><p>&#x201c;<i>One Spirit Medicine</i>offers an opportunity to move beyond misperceived limitations and write new empowering stories for our lives.

Then he threw it straight up into the air and hit it with his open palm. Wham!<br> A perfect shot right into the wastebasket. The only good thing that had happened since he&#x2019;d gotten home from school.<br> Monday was always his worst day. The weekend was over. Kevin&#x2019;s parents both worked late every Monday, so the house was empty when he got home. Sometimes he liked being on his own, having the house to himself. But it was February, the bleakest part of winter, and the house felt cold, even with the heat on.<br> Today school had let out early something about a half-day staff workshop which was usually a good thing. But his best friend, Jason, had a dentist appointment and a guitar lesson, and couldn&#x2019;t hang out after school. The afternoon stretched ahead of Kevin, long and dreary.<br> Plus it seemed like the teachers always loaded up at some kind of giant homework depot over the weekend, unpacking tons of homework every Monday. Kevin had already finished the math worksheet and answered the unit questions about ecosystems for science.<br> He&#x2019;d saved the worst for last.<br> Social studies. Names and dates and places from ages ago. Boring, boringer, boringest.<br> It was a page of social-studies homework that was starting its new life in the wastebasket.<br> Kevin took off his baseball cap, scratched an itchy spot on his forehead, and pulled the cap on again. Then he saw his little rubber bouncy ball on the shelf above the desk. He picked it up and started a game of wall ball. The plunk of the ball against the wall made a steady beat. Thunk thunk thunk . . .<br> It wasn&#x2019;t thunk that he was bad at social studies. Not anywhere thunk close to failing. His grades were right in the middle of the class, pretty much where they were for all his other subjects, except for math. He did better at math, although you&#x2019;d never know it from the way his dad checked his homework. His dad was a genius geek-head number- nerd whiz-brain computer programmer super good at math. He seemed to know the answer before Kevin had even finished reading the problem. Whenever his dad tried to help him with math homework, it was as if they were speaking two different languages.<br> Still, math made sense. When you got the answer, you knew it was right; and when you were wrong, you could figure out the mistake. But social studies? Memorizing stuff that he&#x2019;d never have any use for again, and having to write out answers to those awful essay questions, where right and wrong weren&#x2019;t clear. Well, no, not exactly you could be wrong, that was for sure. But you could also be partly right or even mostly right and still get points taken off your answer.<br> Kevin sighed. He read the question in his social-studies book again.<br> Describe the relationship between King George III and the American colonists, and how this relationship led to the Revolutionary War.&#x201d; Who cares! Kevin raged silently and put a little more into his throw. THUNK. The ball thunked harder against the wall. Why doesn&#x2019;t stupid King George mind his own business and leave me alone?<br> What difference did it make what some old king or queen had done hundreds of years ago thunk THUD!<br> The room shook, as if something heavy had fallen on the floor. Kevin missed the catch, and the ball bounced crazily around the room. He turned to see what had made the noise.<br> twang swish THWOCK!<br> What the ?&#x201d; Now he could see what had made the thwock: An arrow hitting the wall above his desk.<br> An arrow that had pierced his baseball cap, lifted it clean off his head, and pinned it to the wall.<br><br>An arrow?<br> Then he heard a man&#x2019;s voice from somewhere on the other side of the room.<br> Show me your hands, Strange One.&#x201d; A grim voice.<br> Stand slowly and show me your hands.&#x201d; Kevin was too scared to do anything but obey. His knees were shaking as he stood up, turned toward the bed, and opened his hands in front of him. His hands were shaking, too. Stop it, he said silently. Somehow seeing them shake made him feel even more scared.<br> He forced himself to look toward where the voice had come from. About a quarter of a face half a forehead and one wary eye peeped out at him from behind the bed.<br> The owner of that eye was between Kevin and the door. In the next split second, about a billion thoughts ran through Kevin&#x2019;s head, so fast that it was like not thinking at all.<br> How the heck did he get in here? no one else home windows closed no good yelling call 911! Nearest phone in Mom and Dad&#x2019;s room gotta get past him gotta get to the door.<br> The man must have seen Kevin&#x2019;s eyes flicker toward the door.<br> My aarrow would end your life before you took a single step,&#x201d; he said. Do not even think of fleeing. And if you are armed, place your weapon on the floor. Now.&#x201d; The man rose frooooom his crouch holding a bow a genuine bow-and-arrow bow. He wasn&#x2019;t aiming at anything in particular, but he was clearly ready to aim it if he had to.<br> If he aims it at me, I hope I don&#x2019;t pee in my pants.<br> N-not armed,&#x201d; Kevin squeaked.<br> The man glared at him. If you are lying, it will be the last lie you ever tell.&#x201d; Not lying!&#x201d; Still a squeak, but a louder one.<br> Kevin could hardly breathe. He made himself take a lungful of air. Those cop shows on television the victims of the crimes, lots of times they helped the police catch the criminals, didn&#x2019;t they? By giving a good description. . . . Okay, concentrate. Get a good look at this guy.<br> Asian. Long black hair loose around his shoulders. White jacket, baggy white pants. In his twenties, maybe. Kevin realized that he didn&#x2019;t usually think about adults&#x2019; ages, so he wasn&#x2019;t very good at guessing. Not a teenager, but not as old as Kevin&#x2019;s parents.<br> A burglar . . . with a bow and arrows?<br> Who was this guy?<br> They stood in silence for what was probably only a few moments, but it felt to Kevin like a few hours. What&#x2019;s he going to do now?<br> He took another breath. Now he could see a leather strap across the man&#x2019;s body, and the feathered ends of more arrows behind the man&#x2019;s head. They must be in one of those holders what was it called? A quiver. That was it.<br> To his surprise, he heard his own voice. Wh what do you want? And how did you get in here?&#x201d; The man frowned. Did you not see for yourself?&#x201d; he demanded. I lost my balance, fell off the tiger, and landed here.&#x201d; Fell off a tiger?<br> Who was this guy?<br><br>The man kept staring at him fiercely. Definitely at least a little crazy, Kevin thought. Better not make him mad.<br> Kevin was still scared spitless, but somehow it felt better to talk than to stand there shaking. Um, sorry,&#x201d; Kevin said. What happened to the tiger?&#x201d; What a bizarre question . . .<br> For the first time, the man&#x2019;s expression changed from grim to puzzled, and he glanced around the room, as if expecting to find a tiger curled up on Kevin&#x2019;s pillow, maybe, or under the desk. He looked so baffled that Kevin almost felt sorry for him.<br> It&#x2019;s not here,&#x201d; Kevin said. I&#x2019;d have noticed.&#x201d; He tried to remember if his parents had ever said anything about being burgled. Let them take whatever they want, just don&#x2019;t get hurt something like that. He raised his hands a little higher. Um, take whatever you want, okay? Can I can I help you find something?&#x201d; The man faced Kevin again. So many questions,&#x201d; he said sternly. Have you no manners? I am the elder of us. I ask the questions, and you do not speak except to answer.&#x201d; With relief, Kevin watched him take the arrow from the bow and return it to the quiver. Keep the conversation going he seems to be calming down maybe he&#x2019;ll get sick of talking and just leave.<br> I don&#x2019;t mean to be rude or anything,&#x201d; Kevin said, but how would I ever learn stuff if I didn&#x2019;t ask questions?&#x201d; The man looked angry at first, and started to say something. He stopped, closed his mouth, and raised his eyebrows. Then he said, Ha! True enough, Little Frog. Little Frog that croaks away without ceasing! But ask the questions in your head, and then listen. The answers and more will come to you.&#x201d; Kevin shrugged. Okay, I&#x2019;ll listen. Go ahead talk.&#x201d; The frown returned. You do not give commands, either!&#x201d; the man barked. I will speak when I wish to speak!&#x201d; He turned away, took one step, then turned back again. I wish to speak now.&#x201d; Kevin would have laughed except he knew it would make the guy mad. So he tried to make his face look interested and respectful. The interested part was easy he was dying to hear what the man had to say.<br> You have the look of a Yemek, except for your strange garb,&#x201d; the man began, although you could also be Chinese. But it is clear that you are neither, because if you were, you would know who I am.&#x201d; He held his head up proudly.<br> What the heck was a Yemek? I&#x2019;m not Chinese I&#x2019;m Korean,&#x201d; Kevin said. I mean, my grandparents are from there. But I was born here, which makes me American.&#x201d; Why do you speak? I have not asked you a question. What is American&#x2019;?&#x201d; Boy, this guy was hard to follow. And how could he not know what American&#x201d; meant? Definitely crazy. It means someone from America,&#x201d; Kevin said. The United States.&#x201d; The man shook his head. You are Yemek, or you are Chinese. One or the other. Which is it?&#x201d; Neither,&#x201d; Kevin said. I&#x2019;m not from China, and I&#x2019;m not from from Yemek-land, either. I mean, there are about a million countries in the world okay, maybe not a million, but at least hundreds. And one of them is the United States, and that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m from, and that&#x2019;s where you are now. In New York. Dorchester, to be exact.&#x201d; He knew he was babbling, but it seemed to be working the guy still hadn&#x2019;t loaded another arrow onto his bow. Was that what you did with an arrow, loaded&#x201d; it?<br> The man was frowning so hard that his eyebrows were nearly drawn together in a straight line. Slower, Little Frog. What is this you are saying that I am no longer in my own land?&#x201d; You&#x2019;re in New York. It&#x2019;s on the other side of the world from China. And my name is Kevin.&#x201d; He was getting tired of being called Little Frog.&#x201d; That seemed to be something the man could understand easily. Keh-bin,&#x201d; he repeated with a nod. He pronounced it like two words. I am Koh Chu-mong, Skillful Archer.&#x201d; Then he looked at Kevin as if expecting something.<br> Kevin remembered two things almost right away. The first was that in Korea, last names came first. American-style, this guy&#x2019;s name would be Chu-mong Koh. And when his grandparents met their Korean friends, they bowed to each other. The guy was waiting for Kevin to bow. So he did, and when he straightened up again, he saw that the man looked pleased.<br> Ah!&#x201d; he said. I see you are not entirely uncivilized.&#x201d; Gee, thanks, Kevin wanted to say, but he didn&#x2019;t. Instead he said, So, should I call you Mr. Koh?&#x201d; Too late he realized he&#x2019;d asked a question. But the man merely stroked his chin. You may call me . . . Skillful Archer.&#x2019;&#x201d; He paused for a moment. But perhaps that is too boastful. Modesty is a virtue. Archer,&#x2019; then. You may call me Archer.&#x2019;&#x201d; Archer,&#x201d; Kevin repeated. How about if I call you Archie?&#x201d; It seemed like it would be harder to be scared of someone with a friendly name like Archie.<br> Ar-chee? Why do you wish to make this change?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a name, that&#x2019;s all. It&#x2019;s a good name for you Archie the Archer.&#x201d; Ar-chee,&#x201d; the man said, as if trying on the name like a pair of shoes. Does it signify great skill with the bow and arrow?&#x201d; Well, not exactly, but &#x201d; Then it is not a suitable name. I will prove it!&#x201d; Archie Kevin couldn&#x2019;t keep himself from using that name in his head whipped the bow off his shoulder. He had it fully strung and armed with an arrow before Kevin could even move.<br> Archie turned toward the window that looked out over the backyard. Past the big maple tree, you could see the fence that separated the yard from the neighbors&#x2019; Mr. and Mrs. Pettigrew, an older couple. A house-shaped birdfeeder, abandoned by the martins that had flown south for the winter, stood on a pole in the Pettigrews&#x2019; yard.<br> Do you see that miniature house?&#x201d; Archie demanded. I will put my arrow through the hole in the center of it.&#x201d; Kevin only had time to think that Mrs. Pettigrew probably wouldn&#x2019;t like that very much when there was a terrible crashing sound and broken glass was flying everywhere.<br><br>Copyright � 2006 by Linda Sue Park.

In his hard-hitting, inimitable style, he tells of the sacrifices of ordinary grunts in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Korea, and Haiti, and offers a tough-love critique of American military leadership, explaining America's role in new post-Cold War conflicts.<br>Colonel David H. Hackworth is America's most decorated living soldier, with more than one hundred awards, including two Distinguished Service Crosses, nine Silver Stars, eight Bronze Stars for valor, and eight Purple Hearts, which he considers the most meaningful because, he says, "they can't be faked." More than any other military commentator, he has the trust and confidence of the millions of soldiers - from foreign armies as well as our own - who cheered every word of his widely acclaimed autobiography.<br>A wake-up call for military reform, Hazardous Duty pulls no punches in calling America's top political and military leaders to account for selling out duty, honor, and country. Colonel Hackworth returns from America's new battlefields to report that the Pentagon is wasting billions of dollars. He offers no-nonsense solutions for streamlining the military services and rationalizing their missions to confront the new face of war.</p><p>Nobody can question Hackworth's credentials--he's America's most decorated living soldier, a military reporter for<i>Newsweek</i>, and author of the best-selling About Face. In <b>Hazardous Duty</b>, he travels to danger spots like Bosnia, Haiti, Korea, Somalia and the Persian Gulf to rate U.S. military performance. All too often, he sees it coming up short. "Our military machine is sputtering like a worn-out tank," he writes in the final chapter, where he also offers a practical agenda for reform that is sure to raise the hackles of what he calls the Pentagon's "Perfumed Princes and Propaganda Poets."David H.

He's the heir to an empire-but he doesn't want to be. And nobody believes that he could or would walk away, and give the job of ruling the kingdom to someone else.<br> <br>In this roller coaster of a sequel to <i>Not Exactly the Three Musketeers</i>, it looks like the stage is set for a major shake-up in the kingdom. Jason's help in keeping everything from blowing up are the self-appointed soldiers of the errant Jason, sent by that wily off-worlder Walter Slovotsky to keep Jason in one piece . . . more or less.<br><br>There's Kethol, the long and lanky redhead with an easy smile, who's quick with a quip and quicker with a sword; Pirojil, the ugly one, whose looks deceive and whose might and loyalty are worth a kingdom; and the fledgling wizard Erenor, a man who tries to stay two steps ahead of his enemies--as well as one step ahead of his friends. They're all part of the Cullinane retinue, sworn to protect the Cullinane manse and the sometimes-heroic Jason Cullinane and they have their hands full. <br><br>Because no one likes a vacuum--or one too many contenders for power, Jason's soldiers are going to have to do some fast adventuring to make it all turn out all right. <br><br>Next in Joel Rosenberg's bestselling <i>Guardians of the Flame </i>series, <i>Not Quite Scaramouche </i>continues the adventures of the journeyman soldiers of Castle Cullinane (and their sometimes ill-fated leader) in all their raucous glory. <br></p><p><b>Joel Rosenberg</b> is the author of the best-selling <i>Guardians of the Flame</i> books as well as the <i>D'Shai</i> and <i>Keepers of the Hidden Ways</i> series.

Me, I'd rather it was a series of planned accidents, and I can think of a few people I'd very much like to plan some for.<br>--Walter Slovotsky<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It would be infuriating to a lesser man that the emperor didn't see things his way all the time.<br>But Walter Slovotsky wasn't, at least in his own opinion, a lesser man. Besides, life would get boring if everything was easy. Life wasn't boring. Life was, sometimes, far too much the contrary.<br>"My point, do you think?" the emperor more said than asked, lowering his practice sword, his voice level and even, although maybe there was a hint of a challenge in it. Slovotsky wasn't sure.<br>But the emperor's point? That would depend on what rules they were using, if any. By standard practice rules, no point had been scored--Slovotsky's springy practice sword had touched the emperor's leather chest plate within a heartbeat of when the emperor's own sword had scored on Slovotsky's left biceps. Had it been a real fight, Slovotsky would have come out with a painful if not disabling wound, and Thomen Furnael, Emperor of Holtun-Bieme, would have had his belly pierced deeply and would not be wondering at all whose point it was.<br>This style of sparring encouraged defense, and waiting for an opportunity to score a touch, some disabling wound to the arm or leg that would, in a real fight, slow an opponent down enough so that you could go in for the kill safely. Slovotsky's personal preference for that sort of thing was to anchor a foot or leg with a thrown knife from a bit more distance.<br>If he had to engage in a sword fight at all.<br>That wouldn't be anything close to Walter Slovotsky's preferred method of settling a serious argument. A well-sighted rifle at one hundred yards was far preferable, and if the opponent was missing a leg, blindfolded, hobbled, and tied to a stake with a nice circular target pinned over his heart, that would make it all the better.<br>But in life, enemies were rarely considerate enough to arrange things so conveniently, alas. Sometimes--too often--they weren't even considerate enough to identify themselves. Even to themselves.<br>It made for more complication than one would like; it made the dowager empress's naked hatred almost refreshing, by contrast. Almost.<br>"Perhaps you didn't hear me," the emperor said, irritated. "I said, that I thought it was my point."<br>"No, I don't think so," Walter Slovotsky said. He raised his practice sword again in salute. "Or perhaps you're changing the rules on me here when you allow me to change them on more important things?"<br>He couldn't make out Thomen's facial expression through his mask, but a stiffness in the shoulders and posture said that he caught the emperor by surprise. That was a good thing, in moderation. Moderation had its virtues; there was a reason that the term in Dwarvish for dwarves meant "the Moderate People," and Walter Slovotsky liked dwarves, generally.<br>Not that Walter Slovotsky was a big believer in moderation for himself. Nor even a moderate believer in moderation, come to think of it.<br>Thomen didn't answer, at first, then: "Very well. Your point it is." His breath was coming in audible pants, and he removed his mask for a moment as he walked to a side table and poured himself a goblet of water and drank it in one large gulp before setting it back down.<br>He was, for all his flaws, a handsome man, strength of will showing in the bones of his face, and in the too rarely blinking eyes that seemed to miss nothing. His hair was black, jet black, the black of a raven's wing, but his close-cropped beard was shot with gray, as though he was only giving in by stages to the pressures of the Silver Crown and throne of Holtun-Bieme.<br>But as he returned from the side table, there was still that spring in his step that had been too long absent, and Walter Slovotsky wondered if the cause was the program of rest and recreation that Walter and Bren Adahan had talked him into, or whether it was the admittedly lovely Lady Leria that Kethol had brought back from Barony Keranahan.<br>No reason it couldn't be both, of course.<br>"Have at it, shall we?" Thomen asked, replacing his mask.<br>He was loosening up some, granted, Slovotsky decided, but somebody really ought to do something to remove that metaphorical broomstick he had stuck up his butt.<br>The throne room was empty, well, as empty as it got.<br>The Kiaran tapestries still covered the walls; if you squinted, you could almost have believed that you were in a green glen, surrounded by capering fawns frozen in mid-leap by some artistic wizard.<br>The throne itself and the smaller one next to it for the dowager empress--the old, and mean, vicious one, not Andrea Cullinane--remained on their podium, and the long banquet table had been separated into component parts, smaller tables that interlocked at their ends like jigsaw puzzles, and stacked in pairs, top-to-top, in the corner farthest from the great hearth. The thick carpets had been rolled up and carried away to be beaten in the open air, and replaced before Parliament met.<br>But there were no guards or servants, although the latter were as close as the pull of a bell-rope, and the former as close as a loud yell for help.<br>But Walter Slovotsky was one of the few people allowed to come into the emperor's presence either armed or unescorted, and one of the <i>very</i> few allowed into the presence both armed and unescorted--that came with the job of imperial proctor--and neither he nor Thomen particularly wanted House troops to see the emperor lose a point in an embarrassing way.<br>Or, for that matter, to see Slovotsky himself do so. For the emperor, it would be undignified, and Slovotsky had his own legend--read: unwarranted reputation--to maintain.<br>Besides, as much as such a thing was possible under the circumstances, Slovotsky and the emperor were friends, and friends could always use some time to themselves.<br>Straw had been scattered over the bare stone floor, to make the footing more treacherous. In a real fight, you could never count on having good footing beneath you, and Murphy--who, Walter Slovotsky explained to the locals, was the Spirit of Fighting and Battles on the Other Side, which was more true than not--would make sure you never did.<br>Thomen raised his sword in salute, which Slovotsky echoed, and they closed again. This time, Slovotsky tried to draw an attack, but Thomen read the spacing between the two of them better than Slovotsky had, and closed with a quick bounce that led him parry Slovotsky's counter, and then score easily on Slovotsky's sword arm before bouncing back out of range.<br>"Not bad." Walter Slovotsky stepped back and pulled off his mask. There had to be something more comfortable than this boiled-leather hood, ventilated with barely enough slits. An Other Side fencing mask would be ideal, but that would require stiff wire mesh, and New Pittsburgh was far too busy with more important production.<br>Eventually. There were other uses for wire mesh, after all. It would be nice to have all the windows of the castle unshuttered on a hot afternoon, and let the breeze blow through without turning it into a refuge for every bloodsucking bug in the Middle Lands.<br>Slovotsky had to force himself not to scratch at the maddeningly itching cluster at the base of the back of his neck. The fencing mask had been rubbing at the bites, making them worse than usual.<br>It had all been much worse last night than usual, and Slovotsky and Aiea had spent too much of it alternately unshuttering their window when it got too hot and stuffy, and then closing it when the mosquitoes took the open window as an open invitation.<br>Well, if nobody else was going to do it, Slovotsky didn't mind confronting the wizard. Walter and Henrad went way back, after all.<br>"Again," the Emperor commanded, lowering his own mask. "Have at you," he said, in English, the words slurred.<br>"Gesundheit."<br>"Eh?"<br>"Oh. That's English for 'As you would have it, my Emperor.'"<br>"A compact language, this Englits of yours. I should make it a point to learn more of it."<br>"It has its virtues," Walter said, moving in. "Baron Minister Adahan has noted that one, on more than one occasion."<br>They were well into a complicated sequence of counter, riposte, and counter-riposte that was, Slovotsky thought, destined to end with the emperor's blade just enough out of line for Slovotsky to beat it to one side, when the door creaked open behind him.<br>That was enough of a distraction that Thomen was able to judge the distance better than Slovotsky could, and ended the point with a well-judged stop-thrust that actually stung.<br>Slovotsky managed a too late parry, and spun around in annoyance, prepared to give whoever it was a few choice words about interrupting.<br>He was only slightly surprised and vaguely disappointed to see that it was the dowager empress herself, a thin smile on her pinched face as she silently tapped her fingertips together in applause.<br>Well, <i>a</i> dowager empress, at least: Beralyn Furnael, the Emperor's mother. It would have been a lot nicer to see Andrea Cullinane, the late emperor's widow. It wasn't just that Andrea was as lovely from skin to bone as Beralyn was ugly, although that certainly helped things.<br>"Well struck," she said. "Well struck, indeed."<br>Thomen had his mask off and his sword tucked under his arm as he walked swiftly to her for a quick and dutiful kiss.<br>"Good afternoon, Mother," he said. "You're looking well today."<br>She chuckled thinly. "Bieme and the whole Empire are fortunate that you can lie so easily and so well, Thomen. Truth is only an occasional tool of statecraft."<br>Actually, she looked about the same way she usually did, a collection of lumpy flesh covered in black muslin, topped by a sagging-jawed face that was itself framed by a tight helmet of gray hair fastened in a severe bun, small, piggish eyes softening only for a moment when she looked at her son, but har...</p><h2>Lonesome Traveler</h2><p>As he roams the US, Mexico, Morocco, Paris and London, Kerouac records life on the road in prose of pure poetry. Standing on the engine of a train as it rushes past fields of prickly cactus; witnessing his first bullfight in Mexico while high on opium; meditating on a sunlit roof in Tangiers or falling in love with Montmartre - Kerouac reveals both the endless diversity of human life and his own particular philosophy of self-fulfillment.</p><p>Jack Kerouac was born in Lowell, Massachusetts.

To cheer the fall of a bankrupt totalitarian regime is one thing; to build on its ruins a stable democratic state is quite another. The challenge of helping to steer post-Soviet Russia-with its thousands of nuclear weapons and seething ethnic tensions-between the Scylla of a communist restoration and the Charybdis of anarchy fell to the former governor of a poor, landlocked Southern state who had won national election by focusing on domestic issues. No one could have predicted that by the end of Bill Clinton&#x2019;s second term he would meet with his Kremlin counterparts more often than had all of his predecessors from Harry Truman to George Bush combined, or that his presidency and his legacy would be so determined by his need to be his own Russia hand.<br><br>With Bill Clinton at every step was Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state whose expertise was the former Soviet Union. Talbott was Clinton&#x2019;s old friend, one of his most trusted advisers, a frequent envoy on the most sensitive of diplomatic missions and, as this book shows, a sharp-eyed observer. <b>The Russia Hand </b>is without question among the most candid, intimate and illuminating foreign-policy memoirs ever written in the long history of such books. It offers unparalleled insight into the inner workings of policymaking and diplomacy alike. With the scope of nearly a decade, it reveals the hidden play of personalities and the closed-door meetings that shaped the most crucial events of our time, from NATO expansion, missile defense and the Balkan wars to coping with Russia&#x2019;s near-meltdown in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. The book is dominated by two gifted, charismatic and flawed men, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, who quickly formed one of the most intense and consequential bonds in the annals of statecraft. It also sheds new light on Vladimir Putin, as well as the altered landscape after September 11, 2001.<br><br><b>The Russia Hand</b> is the first great memoir about war and peace in the post-cold war world.</p><p>The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s was fraught with turmoil and political peril. That it did not end in disaster was due in no small measure to Russian president Boris Yeltsin, for all his flaws--and, insists former administration insider Strobe Talbott, to Yeltsin's partner in reform, President Bill Clinton. Before Clinton took office in 1992, he imagined that he would devote most of his energies to domestic matters, in keeping with the "It's the economy, stupid" slogan of his campaign war room. But, writes fellow Rhodes Scholar Talbott, his adviser on Russian affairs, "It became apparent that being president meant ... doing the heavy lifting in the management of relations with a giant nation that was reinventing itself and, in doing so, reinventing international politics and requiring us to reinvent American foreign policy." Though the Clinton administration took a few missteps early on, by Talbott's account the president soon rose to the historic occasion, tirelessly helping Yeltsin negotiate the difficult task of democratizing the former Communist power while contending with Yeltsin's troublesome penchant for drink and self-destruction--to say nothing of a committed political resistance on the part of disaffected members of the old guard. That things turned out reasonably well may seem amazing, given some of the incidents Talbott relates. His book offers an instructive, lively view of international diplomacy, personal politics, and the odd turns involved in changing the world. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>"Once again Strobe Talbott has written an important and insightful diplomatic history. This richly crafted book, the first authoritative inside account of President Clinton&#x2019;s personal diplomacy with Russian presidents Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin, could have been written only by Talbott, with his reporter&#x2019;s eye for the telling anecdote, his deep knowledge of Russia, his intimate personal involvement in the events he describes, and his central role as Clinton&#x2019;s 'go-to-guy' on Russia policy. The portraits of Clinton, Yeltsin and others, as well as the blow-by-blow account of the roller coaster Russian-American relationship in the Clinton years, ensure that <i>The Russia Hand </i>will be a sourcebook for future historians."<b><br>--Hedrick L. Smith</b><br><br>"<i>The Russia Hand </i>is easily one of the best memoirs of Presidential diplomacy ever written. With his great command of history, gift of language, sense of detail, and eight years at the center of American foreign policy-making, Strobe Talbott has brought us a fascinating, often surprising account of an historic and pivotal period. <i>The Russia Hand </i>shows us what a complex and impressive achievement it was for the United States to build a lasting relationship with its old enemy of half a century. When historians begin to assess the Presidency of Bill Clinton, this book will be basic and mandatory reading."<br><b>--Michael Beschloss<br><br></b>"Fascinating and compelling reading -- this book is at once a serious political science text and a work of high comedy. Strobe Talbott has given us a marvelous window on a rare moment of important and delicate diplomacy between the United States and Russia and, more important, those two most unlikely partners, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin."<br><b>--David Halberstam<br></b>"A unique document, by turns racy, scholarly, personal, and always of our time. We shall not read its like for a long while. An indispensable and generous contribution to contemporary history."<br><b>--John Le Carre<br><br></b>"Strobe Talbott has written a wonderfully rich and revealing account of the turbulent relationship between the U.S. and Russia during the first post-Cold-War years.

Readers familiar with Starhawk's fiction may remember Maya as the 21st-century rebel leader who was introduced in <i>The Fifth Sacred Thing </i>. In <i>Walking to Mercury</i>, a younger Maya treks through Nepal carrying the ashes of her mother on her back as she searches for a reunion with her sister. Along the way, she finds messages (through the pages of her best friend Johanna's diary, in letters from her former lover Rio, and in notes from her elusive sister) that raise spiritual mountains rivaling the peaks of the Himalayas. She struggles with her past and hopes to find out why the power that once pounded through her like a drumbeat has fallen silent. However, like the metal mercury, the answer to her troubles continually slips through her fingers. While eco-feminism plays a supporting role, the star of <i>Walking to Mercury</i> is everything that Starhawk has to tell us about being human. As Maya discovers, no matter how independent one is, one's life is inextricably entangled with the lives of others--parents, siblings, friends, lovers, and even strangers who nudge us in one direction or another (sometimes imperceptibly) despite our best attempts at isolation. Starhawk permeates every step of Maya's journey with emotion, and pulls no punches, hitting us with everything from grief to ecstasy. There is no padding to separate us from the story, but <i>Walking to Mercury</i> is no stark, utilitarian piece of minimalist fiction. This is life, with all its bitterness and all its magic. <i>--Brian Patterson</i>Critical acclaim for <i>The Fifth Sacred Thing:</i><p>"Slated to be one of the great visionary Utopian novels of the century...It's a rare book to which I give such a high recommendation; but I spent the best part of three days reading it, and at the end, I would have loved it to be longer.

In the course of his quest, he spent days and nights at a time quizzing Savile at his homes in Leeds and Scarborough, lunched with him at venues ranging from humble transport cafes to the Athenaeum club in London and, most memorably, joined him for a short cruise aboard the <i>QE2</i>. <br><br>Dan thought his quest had come to an end in October 2011 when Savile's golden coffin was lowered into a grave dug at a 45-degree angle in a Scarborough cemetery. He was wrong. In the last two and a half years, Dan has been interviewing scores of people, many of them unobtainable while Jimmy was alive.

It happens so regularly you can count on it. Every June and January, starry-eyed and eager craftspeople invade their friendly local yarn supplier bearing fresh-off-the-press copies of the needlework periodicals that are blossoming with elegant and enchanting visions of projects to make, sweaters to create&#x2014;and potential disasters. Part of the knitting instructor&#x2019;s job is to help people understand the techniques necessary for them to complete the project they have chosen to make. Simply by seeing hundreds of garments both in progress and completed means we knitting instructors become painfully aware of what knitted fabric will and will not do. And after fitting and adjusting hundreds of articles on hundreds of different kinds, sizes, and shapes of people, we have become absolutely certain of what shapes knitting will take and what shape the human body will not. So every June and January (and often in between) I gather these starry-eyed and eager knitters around the worktable, and using their new periodicals as texts, I hold an impromptu class called &#x201c;You Can Always Tell What Is Wrong with the Garment by the Way the Model Is Posed.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a fun class with lots of giggles, ah-has, and exclamations such as, &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s why it never looked right!&#x201d; Listen in and join the class. I&#x2019;ll assign you our homework before we begin: Pick up your newest periodical filled with knitting designs and look at the photos. That&#x2019;s all. Just look&#x2014;and then think about them. Your homework is to look for yourself, think for yourself, and learn to recognize for yourself when something is not quite right. With as many patrons around me as I can gather, the lesson starts. Pointing at the cover, I say: Be aware&#x2014;beware&#x2014;of any garment whose model is not standing in a normal relaxed position. A good-looking, well-designed, properly proportioned garment can easily stand scrutiny. It looks good straight on and on straight. The model could just stand there and you&#x2019;d want to make the garment, sure in the knowledge of what the finished product would look like. A sweater worth making has nothing to hide. But what if the model is posed in an exaggerated way so you can&#x2019;t see the neckline or the wrists or both shoulders? The picture above is a perfect example (see fig. 1.1). You can only see one shoulder. The neckline is covered up with a very attractive blouse. But you aren&#x2019;t making the blouse&#x2014;you are making the sweater, and you haven&#x2019;t the foggiest idea how the neck is finished or where it is supposed to sit on the human body. One wrist is covered by a bracelet; the other is hidden in shadow. The model is posed as if she were stretched out in front of a roaring fire, all cuddly and warm. Heaven help her, though, if she&#x2019;d tried to get up and walk to a window to look out. Her sweater would probably drop to her knees, judging by the way the bottom of it is hidden in folds. You&#x2019;d have no idea whether it was a case of a tiny model and a sweater too big for her, or if the waistline was intended to be the hemline. You really need to know what you&#x2019;re making, what it&#x2019;s supposed to look like, and how it&#x2019;s intended to fit before you begin. If you don&#x2019;t know these things, how will you know if you are doing it right? If you can&#x2019;t see the whole garment, don&#x2019;t make it! Next, we all agree, is a picture of a striking handbag (see fig. 1.2). The model is posed in a knit dress, of course, yet this large handsome shoulder bag is the focal point. If this is a knitting book whose instructions are trying to sell the yarn for a knit dress, why cover it up with a luscious handbag? A veteran of misleading photos of knitting projects, whom my class calls Grandma, immediately spots the inconsistencies. &#x201c;She carries that handbag because the shoulders don&#x2019;t fit. Just look at the picture&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t see the left shoulder at all. It&#x2019;s turned away and out of the picture. The right shoulder is covered up with the strap of the bag. What&#x2019;s more, the bag covers her waistline. If the dress looked good, they wouldn&#x2019;t have to hide it. Now, if it had raglan sleeves and if the waist were brought in somehow, it&#x2019;d be good-looking. But they can&#x2019;t fool an old lady like me with a huge handbag.&#x201d; She has learned to separate the fiction from the reality. Younger, less experienced knitters quickly learn to detect the inconsistencies between the photograph and the finished product. One points out that the dress is vertically striped and that all the stripes are the same width from top to bottom. &#x201c;So where did the width at the waist and bust go?&#x201d; A retired salesclerk responds with a laugh. &#x201c;Well, honey, in the old days when I was selling dresses, if it was too big around the waist or in the bust, we&#x2019;d just hold it together in the back while the customer was looking in the mirror. That&#x2019;s the old clothespin-in-the-back trick.&#x201d; The knitters in the class know that they can&#x2019;t walk around with a clothespin in the back, and they won&#x2019;t make this &#x201c;cannot work&#x201d; project. On the next page of the magazine is a study of a sweet young thing in marvelous golden tones (see fig. 1.3). Her hair is spun gold, the sweater tawny gold, and the chair golden brown. We can&#x2019;t tell where one begins and the other ends. It is all one golden glow. The class oohs at the lovely illusion. It is a great mood photograph. But as far as information about the sweater pattern it is trying to sell, it is a big loss. I ask the class, &#x201c;Honestly now, can you visualize yourself in the sweater? Where will the neckline fit around your neck? Where do the shoulders rest? Does it have shoulders at all? Where and how does the garment end? If you make it, you may find out&#x2014;to your dismay!&#x201d; The class ah-has. We flip to the next page. You could order the jewelry from the next photo and know exactly what you would be getting (see fig. 1.4). The sweater, however, is another matter. The class has caught on and learned the lesson well. They ask me to forget the jewelry and tell them about the sweater. I begin. &#x201c;It has a collar.&#x201d; &#x201c;What kind?&#x201d; they ask. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell, but it has sleeves.&#x201d; &#x201c;What kind?&#x201d; &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell.&#x201d; &#x201c;How long are they?&#x201d; they ask. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell, but I don&#x2019;t think that they are long,&#x201d; I answer. &#x201c;How long is the sweater? Where does it end?&#x201d; &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell, but I can tell you that if I try to tuck a sweater into a gathered skirt, I look like a barrel.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t they show the shoulders?&#x201d; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t want to make the sweater, but I do want to know how I can order the jewelry.&#x201d; Because we can&#x2019;t order the jewelry, we turn the page (see fig. 1.5). &#x201c;That&#x2019;s cute.&#x201d; &#x201c;Which one, the sweater or the hat?&#x201d; &#x201c;Both!&#x201d; &#x201c;How can you tell the sweater&#x2019;s &#x2018;cute&#x2019;?&#x201d; &#x201c;What is it made of?&#x201d; &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see. Get a magnifying glass.&#x201d; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s made of some sort of fuzzy stuff.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather make the hat.&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;ve got to admit the hat is a real showstopper.&#x201d; &#x201c;Are there instructions for it?&#x201d; &#x201c;Look on page seventy-eight.&#x201d; &#x201c;No hat instructions.&#x201d; &#x201c;How about the sweater?&#x201d; &#x201c;It has instructions.&#x201d; No one can tell anything about the sweater; there isn&#x2019;t even a graphic drawing. Granny says, &#x201c;If the sweater was worth making they&#x2019;d show it to us. It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;attraction by association.&#x2019; Because the hat is pretty, you just naturally think the sweater is pretty, too.&#x201d; We turn to yet another page, still looking for something to make (see fig. 1.6). &#x201c;A coat&#x2014;I need a short car coat.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always wanted a knitted car coat.&#x201d; &#x201c;Too bad they didn&#x2019;t put that one on a slender model&#x2014;she looks dumpy.&#x201d; &#x201c;She is skinny. Look at her cheekbones and neck. It&#x2019;s the coat that&#x2019;s dumpy and huge.&#x201d; We look at the instructions. They say &#x201c;small, medium, and large.&#x201d; There is no indication of how small &#x201c;small&#x201d; is, nor how large &#x201c;large&#x201d; is. There are no drawings, charts, or measurements included in the instructions. We don&#x2019;t know if it was merely that there was only a slender model available for a large coat when the picture was taken or if the garment was intended to be large and dumpy. Since we don&#x2019;t know what size to make, we can&#x2019;t make the car coat either. Since this book was first published in 1986, manufacturers, magazine and pattern book publishers, and designers have changed their ways. Photos picture the finished garment in a truer light; schematics and drawings of the pieces of the article are usually shown; measurements of both the completed parts and the article are often given. What a change! If this chapter in the original edition made any difference, I&#x2019;m pleased. In the same way we go through the whole periodical, the students getting wiser all the time. Never again will they make a garment they cannot see clearly. Never a garment that has places covered up. They also learn to look at the article with a critical eye, to see that the item fits the human body as it exists and not be taken in by a pattern written strictly by the book. God was not consulted about the variety of human shoulders to be covered. It&#x2019;s not easy, but if you recognize the problem, it can be solved. Try to picture yourself in the garment. Would your broad shoulders fit in those set-in sleeves, or do you need a raglan or drop sleeve for the sweater to fit well and look good?&#x2020; In pictures, the pr...</p></p><h2>The Alexander technique workbook: your personal programme for health, poise and fitness</h2><p>Series: Health workbooks Paperback: 144 pages Publisher: Element Books Ltd (December 1992)</p><p></p><h2>A Colony in a Nation</h2><p><p><strong><em>New York Times</em> best-selling author and Emmy Award&#x2013;winning news anchor Chris Hayes argues that there are really two Americas: a Colony and a Nation.</strong></p><p>America likes to tell itself that it inhabits a postracial world, yet nearly every empirical measure&#x2015;wealth, unemployment, incarceration, school segregation&#x2015;reveals that racial inequality has barely improved since 1968, when Richard Nixon became our first &#x201c;law and order&#x201d; president.

The bow hunters had described where they'd tracked the wounded elk, and he matched the topography against their description.</p> <p>He glassed the basin with binoculars and noted the fingers of pine trees reaching down through the grassy swale and the craterlike depressions in the hollow they'd described. This, he determined, was the place.</p> <p>He'd settled into a familiar routine of riding until his muscles got stiff and his knees hurt. Then he'd climb down and lead his geldings Buddy and Blue Roanie&#x2014;a packhorse he'd named unimaginatively&#x2014;until he could loosen up and work the kinks out. He checked his gear and the panniers on Roanie often to make sure the load was well balanced, and he'd stop so he and his horses could rest and get a drink of water. The second day of riding brought back all the old aches, but they seemed closer to the surface now that he was in his mid-forties.</p> <p>Shifting his weight in the saddle toward the basin, he clicked his tongue and touched Buddy's sides with his spurs. The horse balked.</p> <p>"C'mon, Buddy," Joe said. "Let's go now, you knucklehead."</p> <p>Instead, Buddy turned his head back and seemed to implore Joe not to proceed.</p> <p>"Don't be ridiculous. <i>Go.</i>"</p> <p>Only when he dug his spurs in did Buddy shudder, sigh, and start the descent.</p> <p>"You act like I'm making you march to your death like a beef cow," Joe said. "Knock it off, now." He turned to check that his packhorse was coming along as well. "You doing okay, Blue Roanie? Don't pay any attention to Buddy. He's a knucklehead."</p> <p>But on the way down into the basin, Joe instinctively reached back and touched the butt of his shotgun in the saddle scabbard to assure himself it was there. Then he untied the leather thong that held it fast.</p> <br> <p>It was to have been a five-day horseback patrol before the summer gave way to fall and the hunting seasons began in earnest&#x2014;before a new game warden was assigned the district to take over from Joe, who, after a year in exile, was finally going home. He was more than ready.</p> <p>He'd spent the previous weekend packing up his house and shed and making plans to ride into the mountains on Monday, descend on Friday, and clean out his state-owned home in Baggs for the arrival of the new game warden the first of next week. Baggs ("Home of the Baggs Rattlers!") was a tough, beautiful, raggedy mountain town as old as the state itself. The community sprawled through the Little Snake River Valley on the same unpaved streets Butch Cassidy used to walk. Baggs was so isolated it was known within the department as the "warden's graveyard"&#x2014;the district where game wardens were sent to quit or die. Governor Spencer Rulon had hidden Joe there for his past transgressions, but after Rulon had won a second term in a landslide, he'd sent word through his people that Joe was no longer a liability. As luck had it, at the same time, Phil Kiner in Saddlestring took a new district in Cody and Joe quickly applied for&#x2014;and received&#x2014; his old district north in the Bighorns in Twelve Sleep County, where his family was.</p> <p>Despite his almost giddy excitement about moving back to his wife, Marybeth, and his daughters, he couldn't in good conscience vacate the area without investigating the complaint about the butchered elk. That wouldn't be fair to the new game warden, whoever he or she would be. He'd leave the other reported crimes to the sheriff.</p> <br> <p>Joe Pickett was lean, of medium height and medium build. His gray Stetson Rancher was stained with sweat and red dirt. A few silver hairs caught the sunlight on his temples and unshaved chin. He wore faded Wranglers, scuffed lace-up outfitter boots with stubby spurs, a red uniform shirt with the pronghorn antelope patch on his shoulder, and a badge over his breast pocket with the designation GF-54. A tooled leather belt that identified him as "Joe" held handcuffs, bear spray, and a service issue .40 Glock semiauto.</p> <p>With every mile of his last patrol of the Sierra Madre of southern Wyoming, Joe felt as if he were going back into time and to a place of immense and unnatural silence. With each muffled hoofbeat, the sense of foreboding got stronger until it enveloped him in a calm, dark dread that made the hair prick up on the back of his neck and on his forearms and that set his nerves on edge.</p> <p>The silence was disconcerting. It was late August but the normal alpine soundtrack was switched to mute. There were no insects humming in the grass, no squirrels chattering in the trees to signal his approach, no marmots standing up in the rocks on their hind legs and whistling, no deer or elk rustling in the shadows of the trees rimming the meadows where they fed, no grouse clucking or flushing. Yet he continued on, as if being pulled by a gravitational force. It was as if the front door of a dark and abandoned house slowly opened by itself before he could reach for the handle and the welcome was anything but warm. Despite the brilliant greens of the meadows or the subdued fireworks of alpine flowers, the sun-fused late summer morning seemed ten degrees cooler than it actually was.</p> <p>"Stop spooking yourself," he said aloud and with authority.</p> <p>But it wasn't just him. His horses were unusually twitchy and emotional. He could feel Buddy's tension through the saddle. Buddy's muscles were tight and balled, he breathed rapid shallow breaths, and his ears were up and alert. The old game trail he took was untracked and covered with a thin sheet of pine needles but it switchbacked up the mountain, and as they rose, the sky broke through the canopy and sent shafts of light like jail bars to the forest floor. Joe had to keep nudging and kissing at his mount to keep him going up the face of the mountain into the thick forest. Finally deep into the trees, he yearned for open places where he could see.</p> <br> <p>Joe was still unnerved by a brief conversation he'd had with a dubious local named Dave Farkus the day before at the trailhead.</p> <p>Joe was pulling the cinch tight on Buddy when Farkus emerged from the brush with a spinning rod in his hand. Short and wiry, with muttonchop sideburns and a slack expression on his face, Farkus had opened with, "So you're really goin' up there?"</p> <p>Joe said, "Yup."</p> <p>The fisherman said, "All I know for sure is I drink beer at the Dixon Club bar with about four old-timers who were here long before the energy workers got here and a hell of a lot longer than you. A couple of these guys are old enough they forgot more about these mountains than either of us will ever know. They ran cattle up there and they hunted up there for years. But you know what?"</p> <p>Joe felt a clench in his belly the way Farkus had asked. He said, "What?"</p> <p>"None of them old fellers will go up there anymore. Ever since that runner vanished, they say something just feels wrong."</p> <p>Joe said, "Feelings aren't a lot to go on."</p> <p>"That ain't all," said Farkus. "What about all the break-ins at cabins in the area and parked cars getting their windows smashed in at the trailheads? There's been a lot of that lately."</p> <p>"I heard," Joe said. "Sheriff Baird is looking into that, I believe."</p> <p>Farkus snorted.</p> <p>"Is there something you're not telling me?" Joe had asked.</p> <p>"No. But we all heard some of the rumors. You know, camps being looted. Tents getting slashed. I heard there were a couple of bow hunters who tried to poach an elk before the season opened. They hit one, followed the blood trail for miles to the top, but when they finally found the animal it had already been butchered and the meat all hauled away. Is that true?"</p> <p>Like most hunters who had broken the law, the bow hunters had come to Joe's office and turned themselves in. Joe had cited them for hunting elk out of season, but had been intrigued by their story. They seemed genuinely creeped out by what had happened. "That's what they said."</p> <p>Farkus widened his eyes. "So it's true after all. And that's what you're up to, isn't it? You're going up there to find whoever took their elk if you can. Well, I hope you do. Man, nobody likes the idea of somebody stealing another man's meat. That's beyond the pale. And this Wendigo crap&#x2014;where did that come from? Bunch of Indian mumbo-jumbo. Evil spirits, flesh eaters, I ask you. This ain't Canada, thank God. Wendigos are up there, not here, if they even exist. <i>Heh-heh.</i>"</p> <p>It was not much of a laugh, Joe thought. More like a nervous tic. A way of saying he didn't necessarily believe a word of what he'd just said&#x2014;unless Joe did.</p> <p>Joe said, <i>"Wendigos?"</i></p> <br> <p>They broke through the trees and emerged onto a treeless meadow walled by dark timber, and he stopped to look and listen. Joe squinted, looking for whatever was spooking his horses and him, hoping reluctantly to see a bear, a mountain lion, a wolverine, even a snake. But what he saw were mountains that tumbled like frozen ocean waves all the way south into Colorado, wispy puffball clouds that scudded over him immodestly showing their vulnerable white bellies, and his own mark left behind in the ankle-deep grass: parallel horse tracks, steaming piles of manure. There were no human structures of any kind in view and hadn't been for a full day. No power lines, microwave stations, or cell phone towers. The only proof that he was not riding across the same wilderness in the 1880s were the jet trails looking like snail tracks high in the sky.</p> <br> <p>The range ran south to north. He planned to summit the Sierra Madre by Wednesday, day three, and cross the 10,000-foot Continental Divide near Battle Pass. This was where the bow hunters said their elk had been cut up. Then he would head down toward No Name Creek on the west side of the divide and arrive at his pickup and horse trailer by midday Friday. If all went well.</p> <br> <p>The terrain got rougher the higher he rode, wild and unfamiliar. What he knew of it he'd seen from a helicopter and from aerial survey photos. The mountain range was severe and spectacular, with canyon after canyon, toothy rimrock ridges, and dense old-growth forests that had never been timbered because cutting logging roads into them would have been too technical and expensive to be worth it. The vistas from the summit were like scenery overkill: mountains to the horizon in every direction, veins of aspen in the folds already turning gold, high alpine lakes and cirques like blue poker chips tossed on green felt, hundreds of miles of lodgepole pine trees, many of which were in the throes of dying due to bark beetles and had turned the color of advanced rust.</p> <p>The cirques&#x2014;semicircular hollows with steep walls filled with snowmelt and big enough to boat across&#x2014;stair-stepped their way up the mountains. Those with outlets birthed tiny creeks and water sought water and melded into streams. Other cirques were self-contained: bathtubs that would fill, freeze during winter, and never drain out.</p> <br> <p>Prior to the five-day trek, Joe had been near the spine of the mountains only once, years before, when he was a participant in the massive search-and-rescue effort for the runner Farkus mentioned, Olympic hopeful Diane Shober, who'd parked her car at the trailhead and vanished on a long-distance run on the canyon trail. Her body had never been found. Her face was haunting and ubiquitous, though, because it peered out from hundreds of homemade handbills posted by her parents throughout Wyoming and Colorado. Joe kept her disappearance in mind as he rode, always alert for scraps of clothing, bones, or hair.</p> <p>Since he'd been assigned districts all over the State of Wyoming as both a game warden and Governor Rulon's point man, Joe ascribed certain personality traits to mountain ranges. He conceded his impressions were often unfair and partially based on his mood at the time or things he was going through. Rarely, though, had he changed his mind about a mountain range once he'd established its quirks and rhythms in his mind. The Tetons were flashy, cold, bloodless Eurotrash mountains&#x2014;too spectacular for their own good. They were the mountain equivalent of supermodels. The Gros Ventres were a rich graveyard of human history&#x2014;both American Indian and early white&#x2014;that held their secrets close and refused to accommodate the modern era. The Wind River Mountains were what the Tetons wanted to be: towering, incredibly wealthy with scenery and wildlife, vast, and spiritual. The Bighorns, Joe's mountains in northern Wyoming where his family still was waiting for him, were comfortable, rounded, and wry&#x2014;a retired All-Pro linebacker who still had it.</p> <p>But the Sierra Madre was still a mystery. He couldn't yet warm to the mountains, and he fought against being intimidated by their danger, isolation, and heartless beauty. The fruitless search for Diane Shober had planted the seed in his mind. These mountains were like a glimpse of a beautiful and exotic woman in a passing car, a gun on her lap, who refused to make eye contact.</p> <br> <p>He dismounted once he was on the floor of the basin to ease the pain in his knees and let his horses rest. As always, he wondered how horsemen and horsewomen of the past stayed mounted for hours on end and day after day. No wonder they drank so much whiskey, he thought.</p> <p>Joe led his horses through a stand of widely spaced lodgepole pines that gradually melded into a pocket of rare and twisted knotty pine. Trunks and branches were bizarre in shape and direction, with softball-sized joints like swollen knees. The knotty pine stand covered less than a quarter mile of the forest, just as the elk hunters had described. As he stood on the perimeter of the stand he slowly turned and noted the horizon of the basin that rose like the rim of a bowl in every direction. This was the first cirque. He was struck by how many locations in the mountains looked alike, how without man-made landmarks like power lines or radio towers, wilderness could turn into a maelstrom of green and rocky sameness. He wished the bow hunters had given him precise GPS coordinates so he could be sure this was the place, but the hunters were purists and had not carried Garmins. Still, though, they'd accurately described the basin and the cirque, as well as the knotty pine stand in the floor of it.</p> <p>In the back of his mind, Joe thought that if there really were men hiding out in these mountains stealing elk and vandalizing cabins and cars, they would likely be refugees of the man camps. Over the past few years, as natural-gas fields were drilled north of town, the energy companies had established man camps&#x2014;clumps of adjoining temporary mobile housing in the middle of sagebrush flats for their employees. The men&#x2014;and it was only men&#x2014;lived practically shoulder- to-shoulder. Obviously, it took a certain kind of person to stay there. Most of the temporary residents had traveled hundreds and thousands of miles to the most remote part of the least-populated state to work in the natural-gas fields and live in a man camp. The men were rough, independent, well armed, and flush with cash when they came to town. And when they did, it was the New Wild West. For months at a time, Joe had been called just about every Saturday night to assist the local police and sheriff 's deputies with breaking up fights.</p> <p>When the price of natural gas plummeted and drilling was no longer encouraged, the employees were let go. A half-dozen man camps sat deserted in the sagebrush desert. No one knew where the men went any more than they knew where they'd come from in the first place. That a fe...</p></p><h2>Clash of Kings</h2><p>The second volume of A Song of Ice and Fire, the greatest fantasy epic of the modern age.

NO, as it is known by chemists, is a signaling molecule produced by the body, and is a vasodilator that helps control blood flow to every part of the body. Dr. Ignarro's findings led to the development of Viagra. Nitric Oxide has a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system as well.<br><br>NO relaxes and enlarges the blood vessels, prevents blood clots that trigger strokes and heart attacks, and regulates blood pressure and the accumulation of plaque in the blood vessels. Dr. Ignarro's current research indicates that Nitric Oxide may help lower cholesterol by facilitating the actions of statin drugs like Lipitor. <br><br>The goal of the regimen presented in <i>NO More Heart Disease</i> is to age proof the cardiovascular system, keeping the vascular network clean and elastic through enhanced NO productivity. The plan is easy-to-follow without extreme lifestyle adjustments, involving taking supplements to stimulate Nitric Oxide production, incorporating NO friendly food into the diet, and a moderate exercise program.<br></p><p>Dr. Louis J. Ignarro is a Distinguished Professor of Pharmacology at the UCLA School of Medicine. He has developed a supplement called Niteworks that is distributed by Herbalife.

Following fifteen years with the University of Wisconsin Medical School, Dr. Swenson currently researches and writes full-time about the intersection of culture, health, faith, and the future. As author of the best-selling book Margin, he is a highly requested speaker on the implications of social change to a wide variety of audiences including career, professional, and management groups; most major church denominations; members of Congress, and the Pentagon. He recently released a related book entitled The Overload Syndrome.Swenson veers away from emotional appeals by analytically showing how the economy, man's bent toward evil, and destructive resources including biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons fit into the overall scheme of possible impending calamity. However, Swenson doesn't leave readers without hope. He addresses man's fallen state but discusses in depth God's provision for escape.

She was a celebrated wit, a charmer, and throughout her life a prolific and passionate writer of letters&#x2014;now gathered here.<br><br>Decca&#x2019;s correspondence crackles with irreverent humor and mischief, and with acute insight into human behavior (and misbehavior) that attests to her generous experience of the worlds of politics, the arts, journalism, publishing, and high and low society. Here is correspondence with everyone from Katharine Graham and George Jackson, Betty Friedan, Miss Manners, Julie Andrews, Maya Angelou, Harry Truman, and Hillary Rodham Clinton to Decca&#x2019;s sisters the Duchess of Devonshire and the novelist Nancy Mitford, her parents, her husbands, her children, and her grandchildren.<br><br>In a profile of J.K.

He lives in Berkeley, California.I<br><br>BABY BLUEBLOOD AND HOBOHEMIAN<br>Just enough letters survive from Decca's childhood to give a feel for the peculiar nature of the close-knit, even ingrown, world in which she was raised, mostly in a succession of country mansions and the family's London house. Even without biographical background&#x2014;available in innumerable memoirs, biographies, and autobiographies of the Mitford sisters and their friends&#x2014;Decca's earliest surviving letters convey the self-confidence and freedom that come with a pedigree of privilege, as well as the bantering, chattering, brash playfulness, and the sometimes stinging wit and candor that characterized this particular family.<br><br>As devotees of the family's legend are all too aware, in addition to the secret languages and rituals the children and their parents had numerous nicknames that sometimes showed the daughters' cult of inventive nonsense and sometimes carried political or ironic undertones. In Decca's early letters, Baron Redesdale was "the Old Subhuman" and "the Feudal Remnant," among other names, and both parents were "the Revereds" or the Female (Fem) and Male, although they were most commonly and endearingly simply Muv and Farve.<br><br>Decca's parents, she once wrote, were "Edwardian by chronology but Victorian in ideology." Her father, she said, "acquired [an] extra degree of British jingoism, remarkable even for his class and generation," and she noted that her two Nazi sisters used to refer to him, "approvingly and accurately," as "one of Nature's Fascists."<br><br>Most of the sisters have published their sometimes contradictory recollections, and it is pointless to rehash all their childhood motivations and influences, much less the long-running disputes over the degree of, say, Lady Redesdale's vague detachment or her husband's fiery temper, unwavering habits, or atavistic views. Decca's letters, as well as her memoirs, convey her own reactions, both at the time and in retrospect. Her perceptions of her childhood changed somewhat over time, and more than most writers, she returned to the subject frequently throughout her life, as if she could never quite make sense of it or, indeed, define herself except in terms of the family she left abruptly at the age of nineteen.<br><br>Decca once summed up her sisterly relationships before global and family politics shattered their confined world:<br><br>Boud [Unity] was the one I really adored. Family relationships at that age changed in a kaleidoscope: first one, then 'tother was foremost Loved One amongst the sisters. Nancy was a remote star. Pam, a cypher, a perennial butt of teasing by the rest of us (led by Nancy), &amp; I barely saw her at all; she went off to do farming or something for Diana &amp; [her first husband] Bryan [Guinness] when I was about 12. The Diana relationship (from loving to loathing). . . . Debo &amp; I, closest in age, veered a lot. That is, I think we always had a certain HONNISH* ADORATION of each other, but hardly any common interests, even when v. young.<br><br>Although the Mitfords' financial resources were in decline during her childhood, partly because of Baron Redesdale's fascination with buying and building houses, "we were sort of cosseted, lapped in luxury &amp; comfort," Decca has written. There were always household retainers to attend to their needs and whims. The six daughters were tutored by their mother and then placed, in turn, "under the jurisdiction of a series of inept governesses, from whom we learned next to nothing," she said. The sisters tormented the governesses mercilessly. As but one small example of their habitual defiance, Decca recalled how, when forbidden to say the word "damn," they delighted in infuriating the governess by routinely referring to the cities Rotter and Amster.<br><br>Decca's parents were Conservatives to the core, comforted by the motto on the Redesdale coat of arms: "God careth for us." Decca dated her earliest awareness of the inequities of the English class system to walks she used to take with her mother near their rural Swinbrook home, bearing small charitable gifts for the "village people." Disturbed by their poverty, she recalled asking her mother one day why all the English people's money wasn't divided among everyone, so that no one would be so desperately poor. Her mother, she said, replied, "But that's what Socialists want," explaining that "Socialists want everyone to be poor, but we Conservatives want everyone to be rich." Although she never forgot the anecdote, it was years later before she rebelled against the family's politics. At the time of the general strike in England, when she was nearly nine, she recalled being "a confirmed Tory" and harboring fears of being shot by the "Bolshies." She volunteered in the strikebreakers' canteens&#x2014;a fact that she probably refrained from mentioning when she later joined the Communist Party.<br><br>Her early rebellions were apolitical in nature, like the time when she was forbidden from visiting the estates of shocked neighboring families because she had passed along to her dancing-class friends some information she'd picked up about "conception and [the] birth of babies."<br><br>In her early and midteens, Decca followed her oldest sister and role model Nancy to the left, becoming an "avid reader" of, first, pacifist literature. "By age 12, influenced by Nancy," she wrote in one letter, "I was a crashing intellectual snob." Decca then developed a broader interest in Communist and other left-wing periodicals, pamphlets, and books. As she became more earnest and excited about her newfound socialist insights&#x2014;"suddenly confronted for the first time with a rational explanation of society"&#x2014;she grew disenchanted with Nancy and her fashionably witty friends, who "didn't take anything very seriously."<br><br>Decca once wrote to her grandson James Forman that at about the age of fifteen, "the clarity, the brilliance, the total solution to horrors of war &amp; mass poverty contained in the Communist Manifesto &amp; other writings . . . burst on me like fireworks."<br><br>Thus began her growing estrangement from her parents and class, which continued as she sulked through weekend house parties and fulfilled the coming-of-age rituals demanded of her. "You've no idea of the boredom (to me, anyway) of the company," Decca once wrote to the writer Alex Haley. "Try to visualize twittering debutantes and what we (or I, at least) used to call Chinless Wonders, i.e. the deb escorts&#x2014;goodness they were DULL fellows. What did we talk about? The latest dance, the next ball, who was going." The rituals culminated with her formal presentation at court before "what appear to be two large stuffed figures, nodding and smiling down from their thrones like wound-up toys."<br><br>Decca started confronting her parents on their political views, which her mother evidently took as a generalized sign of her unhappiness. She recalled at one point accusing her mother of being "an Enemy of the Working Class." The "genuinely stung" and angry Lady Redesdale is said to have replied, "I'm <i>not</i> an enemy of the working class! I think some of them are perfectly sweet!"<br><br>Nancy Mitford, thirteen years Decca's elder, was a distant model at best by her teenage years. The only brother, Tom, eight years older, had been sent away to school, as boys were, and was also a less immediate influence. And Pam, born between Nancy and Tom, was so different in temperament and interests, as well as age, that she was hardly an influence at all.<br><br>As young women, the two sisters to whom Decca felt most attached&#x2014;the beautiful and supportive Diana, her elder by seven years, and the ungainly, outrageously quirky Unity, three years older, who was Decca's contemporary in the governesses' schoolroom&#x2014;followed their parents to the right . . . about as far right as they could go. Diana, after three years of marriage to beer heir Bryan Guinness, scandalized her family and her country by divorcing him and beginning an ill-disguised affair with the then-married Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists, whom she later married at the Berlin home of powerful Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels, with Hitler in attendance at the wedding dinner. Still later, during the Second World War, Diana was confined with Mosley in prison. With the exception of their joint appearance at ailing Nancy Mitford's bedside in 1969, Decca was "off speakers" with Diana for the rest of her life.<br><br>At the age of eighteen, Unity, Decca's teenage comrade-in-rebellion against their parents, was a debutante in London and frequently visited Diana and her paramour. Decca believed Unity was fascinated by Mosley and his uniform and "fascinated with the idea of belonging to something." At about the time Unity joined Mosley's British Union of Fascists&#x2014;the Blackshirts&#x2014;Decca, fifteen, resolved to become a Communist, leading to almost comical competing household displays of posters, swastikas, and hammer and sickles. They threw books and records at each other in their common sitting room "until Nanny would come and stop the noise." Decca sang the "Internationale" with Communist sympathizers she encountered on Sunday walks through London's Hyde Park with her governess, she later reported. Unity gave the stiff-armed Nazi salute to townsfolk and flaunted her BUF membership and increasingly right-wing views on a far larger stage.<br><br>In 1933, Unity traveled to Germany with Diana and attended the Nazi Party congress in Nuremberg. It was, Diana later wrote, a trip that "changed Unity's life." While Decca and her cousin Ann Farrer were in Paris for their traditional predebutante "year abroad," Unity took up residence in Munich, which their mother called "her spiritual home." She soon became an obsessed Hitler "groupie," plotting to catch the F�hrer's eye, and basked in his company by special invitation, in Munich and elsewhere. Published photographs showed Unity in Hitler's company, attending Nazi events and giving the "sieg heil" salute. Among her most treasured possessions was the Nazi Party badge given her by Hitler.<br><br>Later, Diana and Unity introduced their parents into Hitler's circle, and both were impressed. Lady Redesdale was especially taken with the F�hrer and fascism and maintained her allegiance long after her husband publicly repudiated his. After a 1937 tea party with Hitler, who incidentally "asked after" Decca, Lady Redesdale gushed in a letter, "He is very 'easy' to be with &amp; no feeling of shyness would be possible, &amp; such very good manners." Decca's reaction: "I was through with the whole lot of them." (Many years later, speaking of her family during this period, Decca commented to a friend, "Do admit they were a rum bunch, &amp; that I'm the only ordinary one of the lot.") Her parents' growing rift on fascism was an important factor in their eventual separation during the war.<br><br>At the age of seventeen, as Decca endured the predebutante social rounds and brooded about a way to realize her fervent commitment to leftist causes, the activities of her second cousins, Esmond and Giles Romilly, captured her attention. The pacifist brothers were in open rebellion against the Officers Training Corps at Wellington College, their fashionable military prep school, where they disrupted Armistice Day observances by distributing pacifist leaflets in the prayerbooks. They edited a magazine called <i>Out of Bounds</i>, billed as "an expos� of the English public school system." Decca wrote in <i>Daughters and Rebels</i>* that "Esmond's abrupt conversion to Communist ideas had come about in a way very similar to my own. He wrote: 'I had a violent antipathy to Conservatism, as I saw it in my relations. I hated militarism . . . and I had read a good deal of pacifist literature. Like many people, I mixed up pacifism with Communism.' " And like Decca, he chanced upon the Communists' <i>Daily Worker </i>and began subscribing.<br><br>Esmond Romilly ran away from the school at the age of fifteen, trailing headlines about "Winston's 'Red' Nephew." He entered London's leftist/bohemian demimonde, editing his magazine and making a living as best he could, for one stretch as a door-to-door salesman. Decca took careful note from afar when Esmond Romilly was detained by police after showing up drunk at his parents' house with another public school runaway, his chum Philip Toynbee. Romilly was declared uncontrollable, sentenced to six weeks in a facility for delinquent boys, and released as a ward of his wealthy elderly cousin Dorothy Allhusen, a widow who was very close to Esmond and whose own son had died in childhood. In her country house Romilly completed the book <i>Out of Bounds</i>, coauthored with his brother and chronicling their controversial radical activities. Decca read it with admiration when it was published in 1935.<br><br>Decca's world continued to splinter as her beloved sister Unity became an ever more flagrant fascist. Unity thrust herself farther into the limelight in mid-1935 when <i>Der St�rmer</i> published her fawning letter of praise for the publication and its virulent anti-Semitism. In a P.S. she wrote, "If you should happen to find room in your paper for this letter, please print my name in full. I do not want my letter initialled U.M. for everyone should know that I am a Jew-hater." And everyone soon did know as the English papers reported on the letter. The headline in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> read "Peer's Daughter as Jew-Hater."<br><br>Decca, overcoming increasing bitterness and friction over her favorite sister's politics&#x2014;at one point they nearly came to blows&#x2014;wrote Unity that she hated what she had written in <i>Der St�rmer</i> but loved her nevertheless. Unity returned the sentiment, in a fashion, two years later, after Decca's elopement, by writing her that she hated Communists as much as Esmond Romilly hated Nazis and "My attitude to Esmond is as follows&#x2014;and I rather expect his to me to be the same. I naturally wouldn't hesitate to shoot him if it was necessary for my cause, and I should expect him to do the same to me. But in the meanwhile, as that isn't necessary, I don't see why we shouldn't be friends, do you." She also told Decca that Hitler had asked about her and as a favor had suppressed news of Decca's elopement to Spain in the German press.<br><br>While Unity was in Munich in the summer and fall of 1936, often in Diana's company, hobnobbing with Hitler, his inner circle, and his storm troopers, Esmond Romilly headed off to Spain to fight with the Republican forces defending Madrid as part of the International Brigade. He was one of the few English survivors of a bloody battle near the village of Boadilla del Monte and returned to England after six weeks, suffering from dysentery.<br><br>Isolated at home with her leftist ideology, yearning to put it to some use, Decca at one point phoned the Communist Party headquarters in London to ask if they needed any women guerrilla volunteers. She also talked with Esmond Romilly's brother, Giles, about the possibility of running away to "where the action was," Spain, which she later said was "a sort of lodestar for people of my generation," in roughly the same way that the black liberation struggle in the South was for her daughter's generation several decades later. She was also trying to find a way to meet Esmond, the cousin she'd never met in childhood because of her mother's dislike for his family. Decca succeeded unexpectedly in January 1937 when she accepted an invitation to spend a weekend at the Marlborough home of Dorothy Allhusen, her own distant relative as well as the cousin and guardian of Esmond Romilly, who Decca subsequently learned was also to be a guest there. (Some accounts suggest that Esmond had casually suggested to his guardian that Decca be invited.)</p><h2>Fresh: Simple, Delicious Recipes to Make You Feel Energized!</h2><p><b>From TV and YouTube star Donal Skehan comes a cookbook jam-packed with healthy, fresh recipes that are as nourishing and energizing as they are delicious.</b><br> Television and YouTube sensation Donal Skehan believes in maximizing health and energy through the enjoyment of flavorful, nutrient-packed food. <i>Fresh</i> embodies this philosophy by focusing on seasonal fruits and vegetables, as well as grains, with a secondary emphasis on high-quality meat and seafood.

In despair, Melville takes his family for a vacation to his cousin&#x2019;s farm in the Berkshires, where he meets Nathaniel Hawthorne at a picnic&#x2014;and his life turns upside down.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Whale</i> chronicles the fervent love affair that grows out of that serendipitous afternoon. Already in debt, Melville recklessly borrows money to purchase a local farm in order to remain near Hawthorne, his newfound muse. The two develop a deep connection marked by tensions and estrangements, and feelings both shared and suppressed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Melville dedicated <i>Moby-Dick</i> to Hawthorne, and Mark Beauregard&#x2019;s novel fills in the story behind that dedication with historical accuracy and exquisite emotional precision, reflecting his nuanced reading of the real letters and journals of Melville, Hawthorne, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and others. An exuberant tale of longing and passion, <i>The Whale</i> captures not only a transformative relationship&#x2014;long the subject of speculation&#x2014;between two of our most enduring authors, but also their exhilarating moment in history, when a community of high-spirited and ambitious writers was creating truly American literature for the first time.</p><p>Mark Beauregard has been a journalist, magazine editor, and, most recently, manager of nonprofit arts and community organizations. He has lived in many places throughout the United States and in Europe and currently resides in Tucson, Arizona.Chapter 1<br><br>The Berkshires<br><br>"We'll have to cancel the picnic, Doctor. It's going to rain."<br><br>"No, it isn't."<br><br>Herman Melville sat fidgeting in a railway car next to Oliver Wendell Holmes, as their train chugged toward Stockbridge. The morning, which had started sunny and calm, was now turning melodramatic, with dark storm clouds clustering overhead like bunches of black grapes ready to spill their juice. The falling air pressure reminded Herman of Indian Ocean typhoons, where the barometer would drop and drop until the ocean seemed to suck the sky down into its depths and then spit it back out again, the exploding rain churning the watery world into chaos above and below. He gazed out the train's window, trying to find some comfort in the bilious clouds.<br><br>Herman was staying at his cousin Robert's bed-and-breakfast in the nearby town of Pittsfield, just down the road from Dr. Holmes's summer estate. He had brought his family to the Berkshires to escape the stifling, malarial heat of Manhattan (and his creditors) while he finished his latest novel, which was all but done-but he could not bring himself to write "The End." He had spent most of the last week just sitting at his cousin's desk, harpooning whales in his head the way insomniacs counted sheep. His English publisher had agreed to purchase the novel for one hundred fifty pounds upon delivery of the manuscript, and the cash would keep the Melville family afloat for another few months; but now that he had almost completed the book, he saw that it was badly conceived and poorly written. He could not imagine the genteel, middle-class ladies of America flocking to buy a novel in which frenzied sharks devoured whale gore and seagulls plucked each other's eyes out fighting for the scraps-and middle-class ladies were the only people who bought books. Even the title seemed calculated for failure: The Whale, as blank and prosaic as its subject, but he could think of nothing better.<br><br>On the bench across from Herman and Dr. Holmes sat Evert Duyckinck, the publisher of Literary World magazine, and Cornelius Mathews, the Broadway playwright, who had arrived together from Manhattan the day before, to visit Dr. Holmes. Duyckinck was long and thin and looked like an advertisement for South America, in black cotton breeches festooned with silver conchos. Mathews was a short, spherical man with robin's-egg glasses that emphasized the pudginess of his cheeks.<br><br>Duyckinck kicked Herman's foot. "Do you not like picnics, Melville? You act as if we were dragging you to a funeral."<br><br>"What?" Herman said distractedly. "No, I enjoy funerals as much as the next man."<br><br>Duyckinck gave Mathews a sidelong glance, and Mathews rolled his eyes. To pass the time, Mathews had been asking Duyckinck riddles, which Duyckinck solved immediately.<br><br>"Without a bridle or a saddle, across a thing I ride astraddle. And those I ride, by help of me, though almost blind, are made to see."<br><br>"Eyeglasses," said Duyckinck. "Next."<br><br>Dr. Holmes's lawyer, Dudley Field, and Dudley's seventeen-year-old sister, Jeanie, sat across the aisle from them. It was Dudley who had organized today's hike up Monument Mountain, as a kind of mixer for his literary clients. In Stockbridge, they would rendezvous with another of Dudley's clients-Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was riding up from Lenox to meet them. Hawthorne was by far the most famous writer among them, even more so than Holmes, owing to the sensational success of The Scarlet Letter earlier that year.<br><br>Mathews said, "I know a word of letters three; add two, and fewer there will be." He withdrew a flask from his waistcoat pocket, unscrewed the cap, and took a sip before offering it to Duyckinck.<br><br>"The answer is few," said Duyckinck. "Add 'er' to make 'fewer.'" He drank from the flask and offered it to Melville, who squinted at him without registering the proffered brandy.<br><br>Herman's mind always drifted far out to sea when he was working on a novel, and he could not quite make sense of the everyday world. The gray ghosts of the whales in his imagination seemed far more real than Duyckinck and his flask-massive blots of darkness adrift in the darker sea of his mind, each leviathan a horror with one giant eye on each side of its unknowing head, looking into the past and the future at once.<br><br>The Whale was a picaresque tale set aboard a Nantucket whaling vessel, an attempt to recapture the simple magic of Herman's early, popular seafaring books. In the novel, a pair of mismatched friends-a New England greenhorn named Ishmael and a Fijian harpooner named Queequeg-found adventure in the blubber and brine of the South Seas whale fishery. The story contained an unlikely quest, in which a monomaniac captain obsessively hunted a single albino whale called Moby Dick through all the wide oceans of the world. When Ahab found the whale and killed it, the adventure ended and Ishmael returned to New England.<br><br>He had intended the book to be a grand farce, full of slapstick capers and irreverent jokes; but bawdy stories of sailors cavorting with half-naked islanders, which had seemed so easy and fun to write in his first two books, held no interest for Herman anymore, and he could not make his current subject-slaughtering whales-appealing at all. The manuscript wasn't droll enough, vivid enough, outrageous enough, anything enough. Even the climax seemed to fall flat: all the elements of a rousing chase were there-the whaleboat seething through the vortex of water created by the harpooned monster; the line rasping and smoking through the chocks; the whale's immense blunt head surfacing in frantic throes; the waves foaming with blood; the crew, panting and exhausted, flinging themselves overboard to avoid the great beast's thrashing tail-but somehow, when Queequeg threw the final harpoon and hauled in the defeated whale, when the blood subsided and Moby Dick rolled dead in the ocean, the story died along with it.<br><br>Duyckinck kicked Herman's foot again. He waved his hand in front of Herman's face and whistled, but Melville looked right through him.<br><br>Apropos of nothing, Herman said, "Holmes, I wish you would write a poem for me, such as the one you wrote about my grandfather."<br><br>"Your grandfather's poem was a eulogy," Holmes replied. "Wouldn't you rather be dead first?"<br><br>"I am. The Post buried me in April."<br><br>"So we're going to a funeral after all," Duyckinck said merrily, and he and Mathews drank.<br><br>Dr. Holmes's first literary success, twenty years before, had been a poem called "The Last Leaf," which celebrated Major Thomas Melville, a leader of the Boston Tea Party. In his later years, Major Melville had often tottered back and forth through Holmes's neighborhood in Boston, wearing the tattered tricornered hat he had worn during the Revolutionary War. The poem had been reprinted widely, and Edgar Allan Poe had extolled it as an example of true American versification, bringing fame to Holmes and a last moment of notoriety to the old major.<br><br>"Perhaps we can all give it a go," Mathews said. "A poetic eulogy for the great Herman Melville, hero of the . . . what was it you were hero of, again? Well, we must work it out in the rhymes, I suppose."<br><br>Holmes sighed. "We have only ten minutes till we reach Stockbridge."<br><br>"Coleridge wrote 'Kubla Khan' in fifteen," Mathews said.<br><br>"But he had the advantage of opium," Holmes said. "And he never did finish it."<br><br>"Don't be a spoilsport, Doctor," said Duyckinck. "You won't ruin your reputation by writing one bad poem. Or one more, I should say."<br><br>Holmes sniffed.<br><br>Jeanie leaned across the aisle and said, "Shall I begin by reciting the original, Dr. Holmes, if we're going to use it as a model?"<br><br>"You know it?" said Holmes.<br><br>"Are you joking? We memorized it in school, alongside 'Yankee Doodle' and the Ten Commandments." Jeanie was a slender, gray-eyed redhead, dressed in the outfit favored by politically progressive women at the moment: a plain, knee-length dress over loose trousers gathered at the ankles. She stood, cleared her throat, and announced, "The Last Leaf."<br><br>I saw him once before,<br><br>As he passed by the door,<br><br>And again<br><br>The pavement stones resound,<br><br>As he totters o'er the ground<br><br>With his cane.<br><br>They say that in his prime,<br><br>Ere the pruning-knife of Time<br><br>Cut him down,<br><br>Not a better man was found<br><br>By the Crier on his round<br><br>Through the town.<br><br>Mathews yawned loudly. "How long is this poem, exactly?"<br><br>Holmes said, "Your recitation is admirable, Miss Field, but perhaps it would be better to skip ahead a bit."<br><br>Jeanie gave Mathews an evil look but did as Holmes requested.<br><br>I know it is a sin<br><br>For me to sit and grin<br><br>At him here;<br><br>But the old three-cornered hat,<br><br>And the breeches, and all that,<br><br>Are so queer!<br><br>And if I should live to be<br><br>The last leaf upon the tree<br><br>In the spring,<br><br>Let them smile, as I do now,<br><br>At the old forsaken bough<br><br>Where I cling.<br><br>Jeanie sat down, and Mathews applauded and huzzahed ironically; then Duyckinck joined in, clapping and hooting, until other passengers craned their necks and peered down the aisle. Jeanie said, "Pearls before swine, Doctor." Holmes shrugged. In his mind, Herman heard the hungry cries of albatrosses wheeling above dead whales shackled to ships.<br><br>"Very well," said Mathews. "Let us memorialize our favorite mariner, as he commands. Shall we each take a verse?"<br><br>Duyckinck declared that he would start. He looked off into the middle distance just beyond Herman's head for a moment to set the mood and declaimed theatrically, "I saw him in a car / with the window ajar / on a train / he asked Holmes for a verse / suitable for his hearse / thus we sang."<br><br>Mathews scoffed. "You can do better, Evert. Train does not rhyme with sang, for instance." And then he cleared his throat ostentatiously and took his turn: "His luxuriant beard / with peach marmalade smeared / from breakfast / he'll taste his peach all day / that's why he seems so fey / and jaundiced."<br><br>Duyckinck said, "Breakfast does not rhyme with jaundiced."<br><br>"Not only that, but the verse isn't true," Jeanie exclaimed.<br><br>"I had not thought truth the object," said Mathews.<br><br>"Look at Mr. Melville's fine, wavy, red beard," Jeanie went on. "It's beautiful. And anyway, even if there were jam in it, how would that make him jaundiced? He's the very picture of health." Her cheeks flushed.<br><br>"It's only a joke, Miss Field," Mathews said. "Peach marmalade sometimes has a yellow tinge."<br><br>"I have seen peach marmalade, Mr. Mathews," Jeanie said. "And I know what a joke is. But perhaps something like this would be better." Jeanie stood up again and recited directly at Herman. "Sometimes when one is strange / he's obliged to arrange / little lies / to hide his truest thought / behind some overwrought / alibis."<br><br>Mathews snorted. "Are you entirely sure you know what a joke is?"<br><br>Herman forgot about the dead whales in his head, in favor of a panic over Miss Field. He stood up, slipped between Mathews's and Duyckinck's knees and crossed the aisle to Jeanie's bench. He took Jeanie's left hand between both of his.<br><br>"What do you mean, strange?" he said.<br><br>"Why, your demeanor, of course. You seem very far away from our little group this morning." Jeanie held Herman's gaze just long enough to let him know that she had noticed something else peculiar about him, beyond his distraction. Herman's heart raced. "Consider it a compliment," she said.<br><br>"Melville has shipwrecked his brains against the rocks of his new novel," Duyckinck said.<br><br>The train slowed. A porter appeared in the car to announce the town of Stockbridge.<br><br>"Thank God," said Dudley. He stood up and said, "Will you kindly unhand my sister, Mr. Melville!"<br><br>Herman looked at him a moment before quite understanding, and then said, "Of course." He let go of Jeanie's hand and took Dudley's instead, who grudgingly shook it; but Herman continued to hold Dudley's hand in both of his and stared enigmatically into Dudley's eyes. Herman said, "Everyone is a little strange."<br><br>"Don't be so sure," Mathews said, and he broke up their hand-holding t?te-&#x2c6;-t?te before Dudley could attempt violence. Mathews slapped Herman hard on the back and led him off down the aisle. Dr. Holmes chivalrously offered Jeanie his arm, and Dudley found himself alone with his indignation when the train came to a full stop at Stockbridge.<br><br>As they walked away from the station, Holmes took a pinch of snuff from his medical bag. The doctor was a short, slight apparition of a man with a narrow peanut of a skull, and he appeared even smaller than usual strolling beside the athletic Jeanie, who was skipping and humming a little tune. Herman, still nettled by Jeanie�s comments, glanced around miserably at the quaintly gabled houses and shops, hoping that pirates or brigands would suddenly charge out.<br><br>At times like this, he wished he had stayed with his friend Toby Greene, on Nuku Hiva Island, the tropical paradise where they had deserted their whaler together many years before; or that he had remained on the Navy frigate United States with Jack Chase, the gallant foretopman he had fallen in love with after shipping out from the Sandwich Islands in '45. Instead, he had chosen respectability, and family, and a literary career that now seemed even more fleeting than the long-ago adventures upon which it was based.<br><br>Herman's first two books, Typee and Omoo-which he had dashed off with the braggadocio of a sailor on shore leave-had become surprise sensations among the ladies' book clubs. Flush with fame, he had attempted something grander in his third book, an allegory whose scope and beauty he thought would rival Milton; but critics had viciously mocked Mardi, and it had failed to sell out its first printing. For his next two books, he had returned to telling more straightforward tales based on his own journeys at sea, but he had lost his easy confidence and his stories had veered into dour social commentary. Redburn featured graphic scenes of babies starving to death on the Liverpool docks; and White-Jacket, his most recent book, detailed the brutality of life in the United States Navy so vividly that it had spurred Congress to abolish shipboard flogging-but flogging victims had apparently been the only people who had bought it. Sales of White-Jacket had failed to cover the publisher's modest advance, which Herman now owed back to the Harper brothers.<br><br>The rain clouds bore down upon them. "We're going to get wet, and no doubt of it," Duyckinck called over his shoulder.<br><br>"No, we're not," said Holmes.<br><br>"Actually, Evert," Dudley said, adopting a lawyerly tone, "nothing is sure in the Berkshires. Those clouds may hold their rain all day, or they may drop it all in Lenox and nowhere else, possibly on a single rooftop, or the whole mountain range may be under water within the hour. In the Berkshires, as in life, one sometimes must sail with the wind and sometimes against it, but the important thing is to keep your sails full."</p><h2>Batman: Face the Face</h2><p>A mysterious vigilante has been murdering Gotham&#39;s highest profile villains and Batman will stop at nothing to uncover the murderer&#39;s identity--even if it means having to protect some of his oldest foes.</p><p>James Robinson is one of Britain&#39;s most successful comics writers, with a host of other credits as well as his multi award-winning Starman saga, including London&#39;s Dark, Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight, Terminator, WildC.A.T.S. and his hugely acclaimed &#39;all ages&#39; series Leave it to Chance.

The main reason he's been able to keep clean: his dealer's in jail, which leaves Jack without a source. When that dealer calls him to Dublin and asks a favor in the soiled, sordid visiting room of Mountjoy Prison, Jack wants to tell him to take a flying leap. But he doesn't, can't, because the dealer's sister is dead, and the guards have called it "death by misadventure." </p><p>The dealer knows that can't be true and begs Jack to have a look, check around, see what he can find out. It's exactly what Jack does, with varying levels of success, to make a living. But he's reluctant, maybe because of who's asking or maybe because of the bad feeling growing in his gut.</p><p>Never one to give in to bad feelings or common sense, Jack agrees to the favor, though he can't possibly know the shocking, deadly consequences he has set in motion. But he and everyone he holds dear will find out soon, sooner than anyone knows, in <i>The Dramatist</i>, the lean and lethal fourth entry in Ken Bruen's award-winning Jack Taylor series.</p></p><p>Ken Bruen has been a finalist for the Egar, Anthony, and Barry Awards, and has won a Macavity Award and a Shamus Award for the Jack Taylor series. Several of Bruen's novels have been adapted for the screen: The first six Jack Taylor novels were adapted into a television series starring Iain Glen; <i>Blitz</i> was adapted into a movie starring Jason Statham; and <i>London Boulevard</i> was adapted into a film starring Colin Farrell and Keira Knightley. Bruen lives in Galway, Ireland.In the fourth adventure of drunken Irish policeman Jack Taylor, he's sober and no longer a cop. That doesn't prevent him from investigating the murders of two college girls, which police think are strange coincidences. Narrator Michael Deehy is expert at playing the snaky detective, but can the police really be that stupid? Deehy single-handedly creates Galway, down to the last brick. The doting landlady, the stout best friend, the pretentious professor are all real and convincing. But while the story is fascinating and perfectly delivered, it sometimes seems like a story told by a long-winded guy at an Irish pub with a pint of Guinness and a love of his own voice.

With the darkness of night as cover, they flee to the big city of Mumbai in hopes of finding work and a brighter future. Gopal is eager to help support his struggling family until school starts, so when a stranger approaches him with the promise of a factory job, he jumps at the offer.</p><p>But Gopal has been deceived. There is no factory, just a small, stuffy sweatshop where he and five other boys are forced to make beaded frames for no money and little food. The boys are forbidden to talk or even to call one another by their real names. In this atmosphere of distrust and isolation, locked in a rundown building in an unknown part of the city, Gopal despairs of ever seeing his family again.</p><p>But late one night, when Gopal decides to share <em>kahanis</em>, or stories, he realizes that storytelling might be the boys' key to holding on to their sense of self and their hope for any kind of future. If he can make them feel more like brothers than enemies, their lives will be more bearable in the shop&#x2014;and they might even find a way to escape.</p></p><p><p>Kashmira Sheth spoke to many child workers in Mumbai as part of her research for <em>Boys Without Names</em>. Kashmira herself was born in Gujarat, India, and moved to the United States when she was seventeen to attend university. She is the author of <em>Blue Jasmine</em>, an IRA Children's Book Award Winner; <em>Koyal Dark</em>, <em>Mango Sweet</em>; and <em>Keeping Corner</em>, an ALA Best Book for Young Adults. The mother of two daughters, Kashmira lives with her husband in Madison, Wisconsin. </p>Grade 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;Eager to find work after his hungry family arrives in Mumbai, 11-year-old Gopal ends up locked in a one-room "factory" making beaded frames with five other boys so beaten down they don't even talk to one another. Gopal's story is not uncommon: a bumper crop year drove prices down, money was borrowed to pay for medicine, the farm was lost but the debt remained, and the family was forced to flee to the city to find work. Gopal stores up his memories of his rural Indian village, with its pond, fruit trees, and bird songs, contrasting them with the noisy stink of their new home at the end of a sewage-laden lane in an overcrowded shantytown. Readers quickly come to care for this clever, perceptive boy who tries hard to do the right thing. Suspense mounts as it becomes clear that escape from the sweatshop will not be easy: the other boys need to be convinced. Storytelling is the key to winning them over, and Sheth includes bits of tales both familiar and new. The author includes more about child labor at the end of this well-told survival story with a social conscience.&#x2014;<i>Kathleen Isaacs, Children's Literature Specialist, Pasadena, MD</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was educated at Harvard, at the Sorbonne in Paris, and at Merton College, Oxford. His early poetry was profoundly influenced by the French symbolists, especially Baudelaire and Laforgue. In his academic studies he specialised in philosophy and logic. His doctoral thesis was on F. H. Bradley. He settled in England in 1915, the year in which he married Vivienne Haigh-Wood and also met his contemporary Ezra Pound for the first time. After teaching for a year or so he joined Lloyds Bank in the City of London in 1917, the year in which he published his first volume, Prufrock and Other Observations. In 1919 Poems was hand-printed by Leonard and Virginia Woolf. His first collection of essays, The Sacred Wood, appeared in 1920. His most famous work, The Waste Land, was published in 1922, the same year as James Joyce&#39;s Ulysses. The poem was included in the first issue of his jouThis re-release of the 1953 recording of Eliot&#39;s poetic drama is a real treasure. Robert Donat plays the pious Archbishop Thomas Becket as he struggles with his instinctive knowledge that King Henry II&#39;s loose tongue will make Thomas a martyr. Donat&#39;s Thomas is sensitive and resigned, without being annoyingly sanctimonious. Also of note are the excellent performances of Thomas&#39;s tempters and of the Chorus. A knowledge of the history is essential to understanding the story as Eliot&#39;s playwriting is a bit demanding for the casual listener. Unfortunately, the liner notes don&#39;t explain quite enough to satisfy the curiosity of a listener who last read about Thomas Becket in a religious studies course. This should not, however, detract from enjoying the smooth, clean production and performance. A.H.A. [Not available in the U.S.] � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>J.

Now, in its Fifteenth Anniversary Edition, Ivan Doig's preface provides stirring details of the making of this memorable book.<br>Ivan Doig grew up in the rugged, elemental Montana wilderness with his father, Charlie, and his grandmother, Bessie Ringer. His life was formed among the sheepherders and characters of small-town saloons and valley ranches as he wandered beside his restless father. Doig's prose resonates as much with the harshness and beauty of the Montana landscape as it does with those moments in memory that determine our lives.<br>What Doig deciphers from his past with piercing clarity is a raw sense not only of the land and how it shapes us but also of the ties to our mothers and fathers, to all those who love and loved us, to those who formed our values in our search of intimacy, independence, love, and family.<br>This powerfully told story is at once especially American and quietly universal in its capacity to awaken a longing for an irretrievable past.</p><p>Ivan Doig (1939-2015) was born in Montana&nbsp;and grew up along the Rocky Mountain Front, the dramatic landscape that has inspired much of his writing. A recipient of a lifetime Distinguished Achievement Award from the Western Literature Association, he is the author of fifteen novels&nbsp;and four&nbsp;works of nonfiction.This is the endearing story of a Montana man's reflections of growing up during a tumultuous, yet enlightening, time in history when life was slower, the landscape was environmentally protected, neighbors more supportive, and a boy's imagination could flourish. Doig describes in detail his mother and father's devotion for him and each other, and paints vivid portraits of a tightly knit family living in a rugged terrain and struggling for survival. After his mother's death, times got tougher, and Doig's portrayal of his dad's difficulties are touching. Poetic interludes are charming and contrast interestingly with Doig's portrayal of a wild and rugged Montana and its curious inhabitants. This unusual and beautifully expressed autobiography is a stunning work of art.

Her role: to serve as a ``medium for their resurrection.'' The memoirs (listed in an annotated bibliography) are by a diverse range of figures: Republicans and Royalists; the young child of Louis XVI; an aging nun; literary folk such as Madame Genlis and Madame de Sta&#x2030;l; illiterate peasants who dictated their adventures; fashionable Parisians and rustics from the French Southwest. But these women, cut off by their sex from the political life that explained the excesses of the Revolution, saw and recorded only the hardship, violence, and suffering--remaining victims and spectators even when they managed, through cross- dressing, to join the battles, or when they served as intermediaries for their men in prison, petitioning for their release. Some of the women, like Charlotte Robespierre, entered history by recording the lives of famous men they were associated with. Others, &#x201a;migr&#x201a;s, helped spread French culture, acquired independence, and brought back to a restored France foreign ideas from Russia, England, and Germany. But Yalom's major theme seems to be writing, and she endows her subjects with many literary associations: Madame Roland, for example, the rare female Republican who perished in the backlash, is compared to Jane Austen for hiding her writing behind conventional domestic activities; to Virginia Woolf when she goes to prison and acquires a room of her own; and to Dostoyevsky, whose career flourished after being rescued--which, sadly, Roland wasn't. Yalom attempts too much here: to illustrate certain feminist assumptions about women in history; to define a genre (the memoir); to place these women in a literary context; and to convey the experiences they recorded. A sound though scattered exposition, then, and a good basis for future research. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

No one knows that better than veterinarian Jessica Vogelsang. <br> With the help of three dogs, Jessica is buoyed through adolescence, veterinary school, and the early years of motherhood. Taffy, the fearsome Lhasa; Emmett, the devil-may-care Golden; and Kekoa, the neurotic senior Labrador, are always by her side, educating her in empathy and understanding for all the oddballs and misfits who come through the vet clinic doors. Also beside her is Kevin, a human friend who lives with the joie de vivre most people only dream of having. <br> From the clueless canine who inadvertently reveals a boyfriend's wandering ways to the companion who sees through a new mother's smiling facade, Jessica's stories from the clinic and life show how her love for canines lifts her up and grounds her, too. <br> Above all, this book reminds us, with gentle humor and honesty, why we put up with the pee on the carpet, the chewed-up shoes, and the late-night trips to the vet: because the animals we love so much can, in fact, change our lives. <br></p><p><b>Dr. Jessica Vogelsang</b> is a veterinarian, mother, and big-time dog person. Dr. Vogelsang worked in emergency and small animal medicine before settling into her current practice providing in-home hospice care for dogs and cats in San Diego. She is the founder of the website pawcurious.com, and her writing has been featured in or on Yahoo!, CNN, <em>Ladies'</em><em> Home Journal</em>, <em>People Pets</em>, <em>Outside </em>magazine, and <em>USA Today</em>."With humor, grace and a wonderfully deft way with words, she escorts us through the trials of vet school and the ups, downs and surprises of a small-animal practice in San Diego...The tales from the front are engrossing, often amusing, and always well told, but no more so than her stories when there are no scalpels or stethoscopes around...So descriptive and wonderfully unaffected is Vogelsang's writing style, one imagines even her case notes would be interesting reads. If it weren't pretty obvious that she's an excellent vet, we'd probably all be suggesting she quit her day job and turn to writing full-time. 3.5 out of 4 stars!"&#x2015;<b><i><em>USA Today</em></i></b><br><br>"It's really quite trite to say "I laughed, I cried" at this book. I know it is, but I can't help it: that about sums up what I found in <em>All Dogs Go to Kevin</em>. . . .This is also a book about family, friendship, untimely loss, and making dreams come fearlessly true. It contains those behind-the-scenes tales and unique client stories you expect in a book by a veterinarian. We learn an important lesson about new motherhood that's "delivered... by a Golden Retriever." And yes, if you've ever loved and lost a pet (particularly, a dog), this book will make you laugh, and you'll cry. At the very least, for sure, "All Dogs Go to Kevin" will make you SIT for awhile."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Myrtle Beach Sun News</em></i></b><br><br>"In a humorous yet poignant style, Vogelsang chronicles the ups and downs of life and how three beloved dogs stood steadfastly by her through childhood anxiety, postpartum depression and plenty of life changes, with encouragement and unconditional love."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Mother Nature Network</em></i></b><br><br>"Intelligent, hysterical and heartrending."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Florida Times-Union</em></i></b><br><br>"This lovely, warmhearted collection of stories in the vein of James Herriot's classic veterinary tales will make you smile, laugh, and want to hug your dog. . . . Instantly endearing and recognizable to those who deeply love dogs. . . . (a) delightful read."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Modern Dog</i></i></b><br><br>"In a manner reminiscent of author/veterinarian James Herriot, Vogelsang shares stories of her canine patients and their human families with kindness and compassion...Vogelsang's experiences as a veterinarian, dog owner, mother, wife, and friend will resonate with readers, encouraging them to join her on a journey caring for others' pets-and to appreciate the unconditional love dogs shower on their human companions."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b><br><br>"Veterinarian Vogelsang pays tribute to the dogs that have played important roles in her life and professional practice . . . She writes movingly . . . A feel-good, bittersweet memoir."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></i></b><br><br>"ALL DOGS GO TO KEVIN is a delightful, funny and heartwarming tale (tail?) of the many dogs that have come through author Jessica Vogelsang's life. It also has the added bonus that Vogelsang is a vet- so she knows stuff! I laughed and recognized myself and thought of the many, many dog people I will gift this book to.

From the Columbia River to the California border, this magnificent continental boundary runs the full range of kinds of beauty - rugged headlands, small coves, sandy beaches, sheer cliffs, fragile estuaries, broad tideflats and dense rain forests. No other photographer spent so much of his life photographing and studying the coast as Ray Atkeson (1907-1990) and few Oregonians have spent so much time traveling its entire length. The result of his quest for beauty is shown in this selection of his full-color photographs, undoubtedly the most beautiful collection on the coast in existence. Here you will see the sunny days and the stormy days, the foggy mornings and the red evenings. There are the sea gulls and the sea lions, the contorted trees and tall, wild rhododendrons. For over four decades, Ray Atkeson&#39;s photos of Northwest subjects have made him an institution; his name has become synonymous with the beauty of the west Coast of America, and no other photographer has so successfully captured the unique beauty of this part of the continent. The text by Archie Satterfield (1933-2011), a Seattle-based author and journalist, traces the history of the Oregon coast, the developmental problems and the emotional highlights of any trip down the coast. Together, the photos and text constitute a song of praise for one of the North American Continent&#39;s natural wonders. It is a modern voyage of discovery you, the reader, will never forget.</p><p></p><h2>Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery</h2><p><p><strong>Soon to be a Netflix film</strong></p><p><strong>One of <em>Slate</em>&#x2019;s Best Nonfiction Books of the Past 25 Years</strong></p><p>A literary account of the lives and presumed serial killings of five &#x201c;Craigslist&#x201d; prostitutes, whose bodies were found on the same Long Island beach in 2010. Based on the New York Magazine cover story.</p><p>Shannan wanted acceptance. Maureen wanted a solution. Megan wanted love. Melissa wanted adventure. Amber wanted to be saved.</p><p>Over the course of three years, each of these young women vanished without a trace: Maureen in 2007, Melissa and Megan in 2009, and Amber and Shannan in 2010. All but one of their bodies was discovered on Gilgo Beach, Long Island, an unsettled, overgrown seven-mile stretch of shoreline on the string of barrier islands along South Oyster Bay.</p><p>Sharing the same profile&#x2014;all were in their twenties, all but one was under five feet tall, and all were prostitutes who advertised on Craigslist&#x2014;the police concluded they were all the victims of one murderer, the Long Island serial killer&#x2014;the most skillful and accomplished serial killer in New York since the &#x201c;Son of Sam,&#x201d; David Berkowitz. But as intrepid young reporter Robert Kolker discovered, the truth about these women went far deeper than common assumptions. The victims weren&#x2019;t outcasts; they weren&#x2019;t kidnapped or enslaved. All came from a slice of America ignored by politicians and the media: the poor, often rural and white parts of the country hit hard by economics, where limited opportunities force people to make hard choices&#x2014;choices that lead them to places like Gilgo Beach.</p><p>Working closely with the women&#x2019;s families, Lost Girls tells the stories of their deaths and their lives, offering a searing portrait of crime and circumstance that goes to the heart of modern America itself.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, July 2013: </strong>As you might expect from the story of a serial killer who preys on prostitutes, the young women in Robert Kolker&#x2019;s enthralling <em>Lost Girls</em> were already, in many ways, lost. Prostitutes and runaways, their murders might have easily elicited a what-did-they-expect shrug. (Certainly that&#x2019;s how the police at times seemed to handle the case). What sets <em>Lost Girls</em> apart is Kolker&#x2019;s empathetic and detailed portrayals of the victims, based on hundreds of hours of interviews with their families and friends. This is an impressive and impassioned work of investigative journalism, and a chilling commentary on the entangled influences of economics, race, technology and politics on sex and murder in the Internet age. Kolker, a reporter for <em>New York</em> magazine, is that rare-breed journalist who latched onto a difficult story and refused to let go. In this haunting tale, he bravely and meticulously recreates the lives of once hopeful but sadly forgotten young women, while shining a light on the economic hardships that pushed them to make tough, risky choices. A colleague told me that after finishing <em>Lost Girls</em> she spent hours researching the victims and the case online. Her warning to me is my promise to you: <em>Be prepared to obsess</em>. --<em>Neal Thompson</em><p><strong>A Globe &amp; Mail 100 Selection</strong></p><p>Award-winning investigative reporter Robert Kolker delivers a haunting and humanizing account of the true-life search for a serial killer still at large on Long Island, in a compelling tale of unsolved murder and Internet prostitution.</p><p>One late spring evening in 2010, Shannan Gilbert, after running through the oceanfront community of Oak Beach screaming for her life, went missing. No one who had heard of her disappearance thought much about what had happened to the twenty-four-year-old: she was a Craigslist prostitute who had been fleeing a scene&#x2014;of what, no one could be sure. The Suffolk County Police, too, seemed to have paid little attention&#x2014;until seven months later, when an unexpected discovery in a bramble alongside a nearby highway turned up four bodies, all evenly spaced, all wrapped in burlap. But none of them Shannan's.</p><p>There was Maureen Brainard-Barnes, last seen at Penn Station in Manhattan three years earlier, and Melissa Barthelemy, last seen in the Bronx in 2009. There was Megan Waterman, last seen leaving a hotel in Hauppage, Long Island, just a month after Shannan's disappearance in 2010, and Amber Lynn Costello, last seen leaving a house in West Babylon a few months later that same year. Like Shannan, all four women were petite and in their twenties, they all came from out of town to work as escorts, and they all advertised on Craigslist and its competitor, Backpage.</p><p>In a triumph of reporting&#x2014;and in a riveting narrative&#x2014;Robert Kolker presents the first detailed look at the shadow world of escorts in the Internet age, where making a living is easier than ever and the dangers remain all too real. He has talked exhaustively with the friends and family of each woman to reveal the three-dimensional truths about their lives, the struggling towns they came from, and the dreams they chased. And he has gained unique access to the Oak Beach neighborhood that has found itself the focus of national media scrutiny&#x2014;where the police have flailed, the body count has risen, and the neighbors have begun pointing fingers at one another. There, in a remote community, out of sight of the beaches and marinas scattered along the South Shore barrier islands, the women's stories come together in death and dark mystery. <em>Lost Girls</em> is a portrait not just of five women, but of unsolved murder in an idyllic part of America, of the underside of the Internet, and of the secrets we keep without admitting to ourselves that we keep them.</p></p><h2>C.S.Lewis : The Companion and Guide</h2><p>The exhaustive and definitive guide to the entire works of C.

What he ended up with instead was <em>The Ocean at the of the Lane</em>--his first adult novel since <em>Anansi Boys</em> came out in 2005, and a narrative so thoughtful and thrilling that it's as difficult to stop reading as it was for Gaiman to stop writing. Forty years ago, our narrator, who was then a seven-year-old boy, unwittingly discovered a neighboring family&#x2019;s supernatural secret. What happens next is an imaginative romp through otherwordly adventure that could only come from Gaiman's magical mind. Childhood innocence is tested and transcended as we see what getting between ancient, mystic forces can cost, as well as what can be gained from the power of true friendship. The result is a captivating tale that is equal parts sweet, sad, and spooky. <em>--Robin A.

A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.</p><p>Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy.

She is the author of 25 other novels.</p><p><b><i>From Chapter One</i></b></p> <p>When my father received the news of the Pendragon's death, I was playing boats by the sea.</p> <p>I was then eleven years old, and as poor a warrior as any boy in my father's realm of the Innsi Erc, the Orcades Islands. Since I also was a very poor hunter, I had little in common with the other boys, the sons of the noble clans of our island, with whom I lived and trained in the Boys' House; and I had still less in common with my elder brother, Agravain, who led the others in making my life difficult, almost as difficult as my father's plans for me did. To escape from the insistent world of warriors and warriors-to-be, I went sometimes to my younger brother, but more often to a secret place I had by the sea.</p> <p>It is about an hour's ride south of my father's fortress of Dun Fionn. A small stream falls down the cliff that edges our island on the west, carving a gully into the rock. At the bottom, trapped by a ledge of harder stone, the stream forms a deep pool behind a gravelly beach before it escapes into the ocean. Overhanging cliff walls make it invisible from the cliff-top, so no one but myself ever discovered its existence. As it was also very beautiful, this made it mine. I gave the place a name-Llyn Gwalch, "Hawk's Stream" in British-and considered it to be a world apart from and better than the Orcades and Dun Fionn. Sometimes I took my harp there, and sang to the waves that came pounding at the beach, flowing into the pool at high tide and hissing in the gravel at low tide.</p> <p>Sometimes I would build fortresses of gravel and mud, and plan battles by the stream as though it were a great river, the boundary between mighty kingdoms. I would picture myself as a great warrior, good at every art of war and sung of in every king's hall in the western world, admired by Agravain and my father. But my favorite game was to build boats and to set them sailing out of the dark pool into the wild grey sea that pounded at every shore of the world at once. I sent my boats west: to Erin, from which my father had sailed years before; and beyond Erin, to that strange island or islands which druids and poets say lie west of the sunset, invisible to all but a few mortals, where the Sidhe live in eternal happiness.</p> <p>I loved my Llyn Gwalch dearly, and jealously guarded it against any intruders from the outside world. I told only my younger brother Medraut of its existence, and then only after swearing him to secrecy. So, when I heard the clatter of a stone from the path above my head, I drew back hurriedly from the curragh I was building and began to clamber up the gully. I had left my pony tethered at the top, and I did not want anyone to come down looking for me.</p> <p>"Gwalchmai?" The voice from the cliff-top was Agravain's.</p> <p>"I'm coming!" I called, and scrambled faster.</p> <p>"You'd better hurry," said Agravain. He sounded angry.</p> <p>"Father's waiting for us. He sent me to find you."</p> <p>I reached the top of the cliff, shook my hair out of my eyes, stared at Agravain. "What does he want?" I didn't like the sound of it. My father hated to wait, and he would certainly be angry by the time I got back to Dun Fionn.</p> <p>"It's no business of yours what he wants." Agravain was, indeed, angry, tired of looking for me, and probably afraid that some of our father's anger would spill over on to him. "By the sun and the wind, can't you hurry?"</p> <p>"I am hurrying." I was untying my pony as I spoke.</p> <p>"Don't answer back to me! You're going to be in trouble enough as it is. We're late, and Father won't like you appearing in front of the guest like that. You're a mess."</p> <p>"Guest?" About to mount, I paused. "Is he a bard or a warrior? Where's he from?"</p> <p>"Britain. I don't know what kingdom. Father sent me out to look for you as soon as he'd spoken with the man, and it's a good thing Diuran saw you riding south, or I'd still be looking." Agravain kicked his horse and set off across the cliff-top at a gallop. "Come on, you little coward!"</p> <p>I swung on to my pony and followed him, ignoring the over-familiar insult. I must be a coward, anyway. If I wasn't, I wouldn't ignore the insult. I'd fight with Agravain, even if I did always lose, and we'd be friends afterwards. He was always friendly after a fight.</p> <p>A guest, from Britain, and an urgent summons. The Briton must have brought some important message. My father had many spies in Britain who reported to him regularly-but they sent their messages by indirect means, never coming to Dun Fionn themselves. A messenger from Britain meant some important event, a major victory over or defeat by the Saxons, the death of some important king, anything which my father could use to further his influence in the south. The Saxons had suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Pendragon's young war-leader only a year before, so it couldn't be that.</p> <p>Some king dead, then, and my father about to make a bargain with his successor? A bargain which had some part in it which Agravain and I could fulfill? I urged my pony faster and passed Agravain at a gallop, anxious and miserable now. My father always made plans for me, but I fulfilled very few of them. The sea-wind and the wind of my speed dried the salt in my hair, and my pony's hooves echoed the beat of the surf; better to think about these than about my father. It would be good to get the confrontation over quickly, as quickly as possible. At least, I thought, looking for some good, Agravain hasn't asked me what I was doing at Llyn Gwalch.</p> <p>The thought of my brother made me look back in alarm. He was a good hundred paces behind me, struggling with his horse on the rough path and scowling furiously. There were two things I could do better than he: riding and harp-playing. He liked to forget this and, as he was infinitely the better at fighting, I tried not to remind him. Now I had done so. I cringed, knowing that he would pick a quarrel with me on a pretext later in the day, and slowed my pony to a trot. He passed me without saying anything and rode in front of me, also at a trot. That was Agravain. He wanted to be first, and nearly always was. First-born, first choice to succeed my father as king, first among the boys of the island who trained to be warriors. My father was immensely proud of him, and never stayed angry at him for long. I stared at my brother's back and wished that I could be like him. We rode on to Dun Fionn in silence.</p> <p>The fortress is built from a very light stone, from which it takes its name, "White Fortress." It is a new stronghold, completed in the year of Agravain's birth, three years before my own, but already it was as famous and powerful as any of the other, older forts, Temair or Emhain Macha in Erin, or Camlann and Din Eidyn in Britain. It stands at the highest point of the cliff, overlooking the sea, ringed by a bank and ditch and its thick, high walls. Two gate-towers, copied from old Roman forts, flank the single westward-facing gate. The fortress was designed by my father, and the power and fame were the result of a myriad of schemes and manoeuvres, political and military, carried out with unvaried success. If it was my mother who was the ultimate source of the schemes, it was my father, King Lot mac Cormac of the Innsi Erc, who had carried them out in such a way as to make himself one of the most powerful kings in either Britain or Erin. As Agravain and I rode in the gates, I wondered nervously what he wanted me to do.</p> (20100902)</p><h2>Stone Fox</h2><p><p><strong>John Reynolds Gardiner's classic action-packed adventure story about a thrilling dogsled race has captivated readers for more than thirty years.</strong></p><p>Based on a Rocky Mountain legend, <em>Stone Fox</em> tells the story of Little Willy, who lives with his grandfather in Wyoming.

Little Willy is determined to win the National Dogsled Race&#x2014;the prize money would save the farm and his grandfather. But he isn't the only one who desperately wants to win. Willy and his brave dog Searchlight must face off against experienced racers, including a Native American man named Stone Fox, who has never lost a race. </p><p>Exciting and heartwarming, this novel has sold millions of copies and was named a <em>New York Times</em> Outstanding Children's Book. </p></p><p><p>There's just no stopping little Willy. Determined to keep their farm going -- and to give his ailing grandfather a reason to live -- the ten-year-old boy hitches his dog, Searchlight, to the plow and harvests the whole potato crop.<br>Now little Willy needs five hundred dollars to pay off ten years' back taxes, or the farm will be taken away from them. Dauntless as ever, he stakes everything on one wild hope: that he and Searchlight can outrun the best dogsled racers in the country -- including the legendary Indian, Stone Fox. But the huge mountain man is every bit as intent on winning the big prize money as little Willy is. And he and his five beautiful Samoyeds haven't lost a race yet....<br>Based on a Rocky Mountain legend, John Reynolds Gardiner's story -- like its hero, little Willy -- has all the ingredients of a winner, right down to the unforeseen drama at the finish line.</p><p>John Reynolds Gardiner (1944&#x2013;2006), who described himself as an &#x201c;author, engineer, inventor, rock-and-roll singer, door-to-door salesman, songwriter, and Santa Claus,&#x201d; traveled widely throughout his life.

Reprint.</p><p>Like <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i>, Iain Pears's <i>Death and Restoration</i> is grounded in a richly cultured vision rife with references to European history, art, and cuisine. And, though it represents the sixth novel in Pears's Jonathan Argyll series, the author subtly informs new readers of the key relationships and the past histories of his characters within the first three chapters. Once again, Argyll and his soon-to-be wife, Flavia di Stefano, are enmeshed in the Italian art world: Flavia, as a member of the Rome police's art squad and Argyll as a professor of art history. <p> The suspense of the novel is sustained by the careful revelation of the central art-theft plot; in turn, each major character becomes the narrative center and offers an expanded understanding of the events at San Giovanni. While Argyll is troubled over his fianc�e's frequent absences just prior to their wedding, Flavia feels compelled to keep odd hours. She's certain that her old nemesis, Mary Verney, has returned to Rome with the intention of committing a major new theft. And Verney, readers soon learn, is herself in jeopardy. She <i>must</i> steal a Madonna icon from the monastery--despite the close scrutiny she faces from the Rome police force--because the sadistic Mikis Charanis has kidnapped Verney's granddaughter, 8-year-old Louise, and he will only release the child when Verney has acquired the artifact from San Giovanni. Underlying each character's concerns is the mystery of the Madonna itself. Why does Charanis covet this piece over the more valuable, though still dubious, Caravaggio that is also in the monastery? In the end, the novel is a perfect melding of a tightly composed mystery plot, witty dialogue, and a realistic sense of character, all flowing from an intellectual's appreciation for the finer things in life. For readers who discovered Pears's fiction through <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i>, the Argyll series--particularly <i>Death and Restoration</i>--offers much to satiate the need for his pleasantly baroque sensibilities. Other works in the Argyll series include <i>The Raphael Affair</i>, <i>The Titian Committee</i>, <i>The Bernini Bust</i>, <i>The Last Judgement</i>, and <i>Giotto's Hand</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p>Iain Pears was born in 1955.

The issue reemerged in the early '90s thanks to Saddam Hussein and revelations of the clandestine and massive buildup of bio-weapons in remote corners of the Soviet Union. The book's description of the Soviet program is horrific. At its peak the program employed thousands of scientists, developing bioengineered pathogens as well as producing hundreds of tons of plague, anthrax, and smallpox annually. The authors conclude that while a biological attack against the United States is not necessarily inevitable, the danger of bio-weapons is too real to be ignored. Well-researched and documented, this book will not disappoint readers looking for a reliable and sober resource on the topic. <i>--Harry C.

Her many fans will find Sarton as celebratory and fresh as ever.</p><p>May Sarton (1912-1995) was an acclaimed poet, novelist, and memoirist.As she enters her ninth decade, Sarton writes in the preface to her 17th collection, "these poems are minimal because my life is reduced to essences." In spite of age and illness, Sarton's voice is still disarmingly fresh and buoyant, whether she is rejoicing in the appearance of a scarlet tanager or describing the challenge of getting dressed in the morning. Spare, delicately focused, and frequently rhymed, her poems are inspired by the small blessings of daily life: the companionship of a beloved cat, a bedside bouquet of fresh flowers, and the changing seasons as viewed from a favorite window. The only missteps are a handful of poems on weighty themes (war and destructiveness in general) that blunder awkwardly into the poet's intimate world of house, garden, and memory. Perhaps what Sarton hopes to leave with her readers is the gift of her own example of awareness and resilience: "I am still whole and merry/ And when all's said and done/Rejoice in my strange story,/Ardent and alone."

They really should have known better. When Lady Rosamund runs away from home to marry a traveling player, former knight errant Michael makes a noble promise to help the object of his unrequited love. The quest takes our would-be heroes to the coastal town of Huckerston, where savage sea pirates called wreckers terrorize the coast. With the help of a reluctant Fisk, Michael plans on catching the wreckers and winning back his lady; but when mysterious murders and dangerous accidents threaten the town and its players, love might be the least of his problems. . . .</p><p>Part buddy novel, part medieval whodunit, the latest installment of Hilari Bell's Knight and Rogue Novels continues the boys' saga with another classic tale of mishaps, wit, and adventure. </p></p><p><p>Hilari Bell used to work as a reference librarian, but she now writes science fiction and fantasy for kids and teens from her home base in Denver, Colorado.Hilari&#x2019;s favorite activity is camping, when she spends all her time reading and hiking.

Well, I take that back&#x2014;when it comes to reading, there&#x2019;s no such thing as enough.&#x201d;</p>Grade 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;This book continues the adventures of Michael Sevenson, a self-proclaimed knight errant (although they went out of fashion a couple of hundred years ago) and his squire, Fisk, a former con artist. The duo travel to Huckerston, a port town where wreckers are at work. Michael's distant cousin and love interest, the fair Rosamund, has run away to Huckerston to join her love, Rudy, a tightrope walker who is missing some toes. He is a traveling player with Mr. Makejoye's troupe, which the knight and squire join. Much of the book's humor and appeal comes from the friendship and interplay between Michael and Fisk, the former well-intentioned but foolhardy, while the latter is more reality-based and cynical. They tell the story in alternating chapters as they encounter murder, piracy, robbery, and all sorts of chaos while they try to expose the wreckers, find the loot, and woo Rosamund. Michael is able to see magic in objects and has the gift of animal handling, which is helpful in offsetting his gift of attracting trouble. The time period feels medieval, yet street lamps are mentioned, as is Fisk's former job as a bouncer in a tavern. This incongruity adds to the book's humor. A blend of fantasy, adventure, and mystery, with a large cast of characters and a fast-paced plot, this installment will appeal most to fans of the previous titles.&#x2014;<i>Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, ME</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

If one inquired of a random guest why he or she had trundled all the way from London to the castle estate, the most likely, and fictive, response would have been to enjoy the concerts, the extravagant raffles, the elaborate sporting events that brought back the glory of medieval days. <br><br>Few, in actual fact, attended Alton&#x2019;s party for the cultural upliftment offered, or to compete in the vigorous athletic competitions. It was the pursuit of passion that beckoned the energetic youth of the beau monde. <br>By the dessert course of the Friday-evening supper that began the house party, most of the guests had singled out which gentleman or lady they wished to pursue. <br><br>By Saturday morning, Eros, son of Venus, had discharged nearly all of his golden arrows. Some hearts had already begun to bleed. Some had taken wing. <br><br>The well-experienced servants of the estate, from the elderly majordomo to the youthful maids, stood at the ready to accept bribes in the cause of amorous conquests. Chambers could be changed with complete discretion at a moment&#x2019;s notice, doors unlocked at a whim. A footman would gladly serve as a loyal guard during a garden tryst for hours on end. <br><br>Lord Devon Boscastle and his acquaintances made no bones about why they&#x2019;d accepted Fernshaw&#x2019;s annual invitation. Devon planned to excel at a more provocative game than jousting at a mock tournament, chivalric pretensions be damned. He&#x2019;d already selected his partner and, to judge by the come-hither looks she was casting him across the crowded salon, Mrs. Lily Cranleigh was as eager for a liaison as he was. <br><br>She lifted her glass of champagne at him as if in a toast, and smiled. <br><br>Before he could respond, she turned on her heel and walked to the door without a backward glance, her gray silk half-mourning dress clinging to her lush hips, her swansdown boa draped over one flawless white shoulder. <br><br>Well, that was an opening if ever he&#x2019;d been issued one. <br><br>He waited several minutes before following. There was no advantage in appearing too eager even though both he and the licentious widow were unattached. <br><br>Let the lady smolder a little longer. He&#x2019;d been quietly pursuing her for weeks. <br><br>It was now his turn to tease. <br><br>He turned, deep in pleasant thoughts, and found himself unexpectedly face to face with another, far less friendly, female guest. A young country miss with whom he shared a transient if embarrassing bit of history. <br><br>Jocelyn Lydbury. <br><br>Once upon a time, before Devon had completely ruined his own reputation, Major-General Sir Gideon Lydbury, Jocelyn&#x2019;s father, had cast his eye upon Devon as a potential husband for his only daughter. <br><br>Devon had been asked to the ancestral country pile for a lavish dinner. The problem was, he had completely forgotten to attend because he&#x2019;d been carousing in the low dives of London. After all, he&#x2019;d just enlisted in the cavalry and thought it quite possible that he&#x2019;d be killed or injured his first year out. He&#x2019;d seen no point in planning a future. <br><br>Sir Gideon, who did not share in this fatalistic view, immediately let the whole of London know that he had not appreciated the social insult, war or no war. The matter might have blown over had the man not taken a seat in Parliament and gained the political support of Devon&#x2019;s eldest brother, Grayson, the Marquess of Sedgecroft. Even now, from time to time Sir Gideon reminded Grayson that he had not forgotten the slight. <br><br>And, of course, Grayson, in turn, reminded Devon. <br><br>Devon assessed the woman before him with an experienced glance. Her hair was not the ordinary brown he&#x2019;d thought it was, but a deep burnished-gold becomingly swept back from her face in an elegant coil. Her face was one that the years had rendered more appealing than he remembered. Her dark eyes held his gaze. <br><br>&#x201c;Jocelyn,&#x201d; he said, a practiced smile in place, &#x201c;what a nice surprise. I didn&#x2019;t realize you were one of Fernshaw&#x2019;s guests.&#x201d; In his mind she was an unsophisticated debutante who should probably remain shielded from the risqu� goings-on that one expected at a party like this. <br><br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t here by yourself, are you?&#x201d; he asked curiously. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen your brother anywhere. I seem to recall he used to follow you like a shadow.&#x201d; <br><br>Her skeptical gaze swept past him to the door through which Lily Cranleigh had made her enticing exit. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s right there in the corner. You were too preoccupied watching the notorious widow, I expect.&#x201d; She gave him a rueful look. &#x201c;Some people never seem to change, and obviously you are one of them. Good evening, Devon, and good-bye.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Have you changed?&#x201d; he asked, challenging her coolness. <br><br>She answered him with surprising honesty. &#x201c;I hope so. For one thing, I should like to think I&#x2019;m a better judge of character than I was a few years ago. I don&#x2019;t invite just anyone to dinner these days, at least. I&#x2019;m more discriminating in who I ask to slight me. Is that what you were wondering?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I suppose I deserve that,&#x201d; he said with a rueful smile. <br><br>She laughed softly. &#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s not hope you get everything you deserve.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Now that was cruel.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It was actually kind. I don&#x2019;t imagine men like you deliberately go about doing hurtful things.&#x201d; <br><br>He shook his head. Of course he hadn&#x2019;t meant to hurt her, but it was obvious he had. God knew she&#x2019;d have come out even worse if he had accepted her father&#x2019;s invitation and actually courted her. He didn&#x2019;t think he could ever be the sort of man who&#x2019;d live up to a decent young woman&#x2019;s idea of love. <br><br>Which didn&#x2019;t mean he&#x2019;d object to sharing his views on that subject with her. He was pleasantly surprised by the touch of cynicism that he sensed beneath her soft appeal. What had made her so? he wondered. Weren&#x2019;t her father and brother the overprotective type? <br><br>&#x201c;How long has it been since I offended you?&#x201d; he asked in an undertone. &#x201c;And is there nothing I can do to make amends?&#x201d; <br><br>The last question escaped him unbidden. He&#x2019;d felt no previous desire to atone for his past behavior. Why the devil bother now? <br><br>Jocelyn Lydbury. <br><br>Too tempting up close for a country wallflower. Four years had certainly made a difference for the better in her, or perhaps it was only his perspective that had matured. <br><br>She wasn&#x2019;t lushly attractive in the flagrant sense, as was his widow. But there was something about her, a subtle but intriguing quality that made him wonder what he&#x2019;d missed. <br><br>An aloof, untouchable young lady. Virtue to his vice, demure to his decadence. Good breeding stock to put it crudely. He&#x2019;d always thought of her as a one-day girl&#x2013;the sort of girl a marriage-minded man would desire in the distant future when and if he ever had the urge for a stable association. <br><br>Which Devon didn&#x2019;t. <br><br>Besides, she was far better off without a man like him, no matter what she or her father might have thought. She had clearly never recovered from his offense, and aside from apologizing, there wasn&#x2019;t anything else to do for it. <br><br>Her next question, however, prompted him to wonder if he&#x2019;d overappraised his place in her life. <br><br>&#x201c;What makes you think you offended me?&#x201d; she asked in mischievous amusement. <br><br>His dark eyebrows lifted in reaction. Perhaps he should have paid closer attention to her in the past. She had a long-limbed, slender body that curved softly in all the right places to whet a man&#x2019;s appetite. He was sure she hadn&#x2019;t shown this intriguing sense of self the few times they&#x2019;d met. <br><br>&#x201c;I know that to slight you was rude,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But the war was on, and&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>She glanced around his shoulder, apparently distracted by something across the room. &#x201c;You slighted my father,&#x201d; she said with a dismissive laugh. &#x201c;And you don&#x2019;t have to do anything to make amends except . . . &#x201d; <br><br>He felt a rather irritating sting of curiosity and wondered if he&#x2019;d grown too accustomed to easy conquests. &#x201c;Except what?&#x201d; <br><br>She looked at him levelly, then whispered, &#x201c;Except to let me go <i>now. </i>Devon, I do not wish to offend you, but you are really in my way. Please allow me to pass. I don&#x2019;t want to be seen talking to you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You did wound me before if that makes you feel better.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Why would it make me feel better?&#x201d; he asked, mildly outraged. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Believe it,&#x201d; she broke in. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not angry anymore. I just wish to . . . to not talk to you. Honestly, everything is fine. It&#x2019;s over, that&#x2019;s all. I&#x2019;ve forgiven you.&#x201d; <br><br>He studied her with a reluctant smile. He knew he ought to let her go her innocent way, and he would, but it wasn&#x2019;t in his Boscastle nature to allow an offense against a lady to remain unpaid. He&#x2019;d hurt her, thoughtless bastard that he had been. He wasn&#x2019;t sure he was any better now, but these days he tried to put more thought into his actions. It was true that he still indulged in sinful pleasures, but with a trifle more discretion, which was why he&#x2019;d come to Alton&#x2019;s party. . . . <br><br>The thought triggered another possibility. <br><br>&#x201c;Do you have an assignation, Jocelyn?&#x201d; he inquired in a low voice. <br><br>One delicate eyebrow rose. &#x201c;Is that all you think about?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Well, what do you think about?&#x201d; he asked, aware that she had evaded the question. <br><br>&#x201c;About finer things. About integrity and literature, and&#x2013; I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it. Or to you. You&#x2019;re going to get me in trouble, and you know it.&#x201d; <br><br>He had to smile; the set-down was duly deserved but unexpected. He wasn&#x2019;t inclined to force a bud into bloom, no matter how promising, although he probably wouldn&#x2019;t have minded being discharged half so much if he hadn&#x2019;t felt he merited a scolding. And if he hadn&#x2019;t realized that Jocelyn&#x2019;s attention was focused on Lord Adam Chiswick, a good-looking blond cavalry officer who&#x2019;d served in a different regiment than Devon&#x2019;s, but who didn&#x2019;t have a brain in his handsome head. <br><br>He grinned, murmuring, &#x201c;There are more assignations in the air than dust motes in my grandmother&#x2019;s drawing room.&#x201d; <br><br>She gave him a knowing smile. &#x201c;Speaking of which, your widow won&#x2019;t wait for you forever. A number of your friends are seeking her companionship at the party. You&#x2019;ve fierce competition for her favor. I think you should step up the hunt if you don&#x2019;t want to lose her.&#x201d; <br><br>He straightened. She had even white teeth, the faintest scar on the curve on her right cheekbone, and a forthright way of speaking that shouldn&#x2019;t have appealed to him, but did. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t wait for me, did you, darling?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said softly, &#x201c;as difficult as it may be for a Boscastle to believe. But let us not harbor ill feelings. I told you, I&#x2019;ve forgiven you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And forgotten me?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She bit the edge of her lip. &#x201c;Well, almost.&#x201d; <br><br>He moved aside. She brushed around him, her slender body so visibly tense that naturally he wished to soothe her. <br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps I don&#x2019;t want to be forgotten,&#x201d; he said in an undertone, catching her elbow in his hand. <br><br>She laughed in disbelief. &#x201c;Perhaps you don&#x2019;t have a choice.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Are you challenging me?&#x201d; he asked, his heavy-lidded gaze holding hers. <br><br>&#x201c;Only if the weapons are either pistols or swords.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Be careful with Chiswick, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he murmured as he released her arm. &#x201c;I think you may be a little too much for him to control.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;You might need a man with more practical experience.&#x201d; <br><br>She stared back at him with a faintly patronizing look. &#x201c;As if I would take the advice of a rogue like you.&#x201d; <br><br>He laughed without the least offense. She might have convinced him of her disinterest had he not heard the faintest quaver in her voice. &#x201c;Jocelyn, it is only because I&#x2019;m a rogue that I am qualified to warn you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Adam is a perfect gentleman.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the worst kind.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; she asked guardedly. <br><br>&#x201c;All the devilry builds up in that sort of man. Look at him. Right now I&#x2019;ll warrant he&#x2019;s seething inside like a volcano.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Is that right?&#x201d; she said with a cynical smile. <br><br>He schooled himself to look completely serious. &#x201c;Trust me, if a man does not let a little steam escape here and there, he&#x2019;s liable to explode and give everyone around him a nasty burn.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I dislike challenging your profound theory on the building of . . . passion, Devon, but not all men are as full of steam as you and your brothers.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I could expound on the theory in private if you&#x2019;re interested,&#x201d; he said quietly. <br><br>&#x201c;Before or after Lily Cranleigh?&#x201d; <br><br>He hesitated, surprised but not about to admit that Lily had been the farthest thing from his mind. His unexpected encounter with Jocelyn had completely absorbed him. <br><br>&#x201c;Consider my offer,&#x201d; he murmered, not certain himself what he meant but leaving the door open. <br><br>And finding it closed firmly in his face. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t wish to be hurt again,&#x201d; she replied with a rueful smile. <br><br>&#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t wish to hurt you.&#x201d; <br><br>He rested his elbow up against the wall. Where he stood, he could almost feel the warmth of her shoulder and soft, enticing breasts. He imagined he could see the rim of a pink half-moon nipple beneath her gown, and even if it was only his imagination it made his mouth water. Her lips parted slightly, but the pattern of her breathing did not change. <br><br>She turned, then paused, glancing back at him. Their gazes met, engaged, withdrew. How innocent was she? he wondered curiously. Had she and Chiswick been lovers for long, or was this her initiation night? <br>Fernshaw&#x2019;s parties were famous for igniting torrid love affairs. <br><br>He shrugged off the thought. To whom she gave her virtue, or when, was certainly none of his affair. He had relinquished any claim he might have made on her four years ago. <br><br>&#x201c;It was nice to see you again, Jocelyn. You really are more lovely than I remembered.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for saying that, Devon,&#x201d; she retorted, her grin implying that they would at least part on amicable terms. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s reassuring to know that you&#x2019;re a worse rogue than I remembered, too.&#x201d; <br><br>And that she had escaped him. <br><br>She didn&#x2019;t need to speak aloud the thought for him to guess that that was what she was telling herself. He smiled. She&#x2019;d be right, too, God love her. He had not been a man for marriage four years ago, and he was less of one now.</p><h2>Angel Child, Dragon Child</h2><p>In this story based on a young girl&#39;s true-life experiences, Ut, a Vietnamese child separated from her family, recounts her attempts to come to terms with a new country and a new life and to reunite her family</p><p></p><h2>The Emergence of Hyper-Calvinism in English Nonconformity, 1689-1765</h2><p>During the past three years Peter Toon published articles dealing with various facets of Calvinistic theology in the Age of Reason. These articles were by-products of research he was conducting at London University into the origins of a logical, arid form of Calvinism (hyper-Calvinism) found among Congregationalists and Baptists in the first half of the 18th century. His thesis was completed in March 1967, and with some modifications is now published as a book. Though his study has particular relevance to Strict Baptist, who have become the custodians of hyper-Calvinism, it is also a contribution to our knowledge of the 18th century Nonconformity as well as the history of the development of Reformed doctrine. In the Preface Dr. J. I. Packer states: &#34;The story is a cautionary tale with timely lessons for those who seek a revival of Reformed Christianity today.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Ezekiel (Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching &amp; Preaching) (Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching)</h2><p><p>This major work explores the message and meaning of Ezekiel, one of the longest and most difficult of the prophetic books.

The professional malpractices of the publisher of the Quarto, as described in documents in the Public Record Office, and the professional zeal of the Folio scribe, who wished to tidy and correct Shakespeare&#39;s manuscript, introduced many plausible but post-Shakespearean readings into the text, which call into question a number of our assumptions about the play. As well as investigating the implications of these findings about the early texts, the editor offers a wider background to the play, discussing major critical issues, the play in performance and the relationship between reading and seeing it, and topics such as its date, sources, the famous conundrum of &#34;double time&#34;, and its &#34;greatness&#34; compared with &#34;Hamlet&#34; and &#34;King Lear&#34;.

They reveal new facts and provide startling insight into Pistol Pete Maravich, who lived a life of triumph and tragedy before finding happiness in religion in the years before his death at age 40."Pistol Pete is a legend to all who understand the history of basketball." -- Jason Kidd <p>From childhood "Pistol" Pete Maravich mesmerized fans and opponents alike with audacious ball handling and prodigious scoring. Julius Erving called him "a basketball genius." The mop-topped, floppy-socked prodigy was a legend at LSU, averaging a staggering 44.2 points per game--the highest in NCAA history. Then a brilliant pro career with the Hawks, Jazz and Celtics led to enshrinement in the Hall of Fame and selection as one of the top 50 players in NBA history. </p><p>But there was a price. Maravich brought a child-like exuberance to the court that often masked a tortured and confused adult. His obsessive personality--he often referred to himself as a "basketball android"--and inability to win a championship triggered despair and thoughts of suicide. Eventually he found peace in Christianity and a quiet home life. </p><p>Then, at age 40, Maravich died. The exact cause--a congenital heart defect-- stunned both the sports and medical worlds. Pistol Pete had been living on borrowed time. It was called a medical miracle that he survived his teens, let alone become a superstar athlete. </p><p>Now, after staying silent for two decades, Maravich's widow, Jackie, has welcomed authors Wayne Federman and Marshall Terrill into Pistol Pete's private world. She has shared personal memories and provided unfettered access to the Maravich family archive of clippings, films, letters, calendars, diaries, and photographs to allow Pete's story to be fully told. </p><p>The result is the definitive biography of "Pistol" Pete Maravich. In addition to countless hours spent with Jackie and her sons, Jaeson and Joshua, the authors interviewed more than 300 teammates, opponents, journalists, coaches, detractors, fans, and extended family to bring back to vivid life the story of a transcendent athlete who thrilled everyone except himself. Also included is a comprehensive appendix of Maravich statistics, plus Pistol Pete's 25 greatest games.</p></p><h2>Pioneer Days in the Early Southwest</h2><p>This pioneering work is about the traders, trappers, and explorers in the vast area that would become Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, New Mexico, Kansas, and Colorado. Foreman describes the early explorations of the French and Spanish in the Louisiana Territory and often focuses on the junction of the Verdigris, Grand, and Arkansas rivers, known as the Three Forks, a trading and military center from which the conquest of a large part of the American Southwest was achieved. <p>Viewed in historical perspective are the business enterprises of A. P. Chouteau and others; treaties with the Indians and warfare between the Cherokees and Osage; massacres and disease epidemics; garrison life at Fort Gibson and the visits of writer Washington Irving and painter George Catlin; expeditions into the Southwest led by Colonel Henry Dodge, Captain Benjamin de Bonneville, and others; Sam Houston's sojourn in Indian country; and warfare on the Texas border.</p></p><p>Grant Foreman is highly regarded as an authority on the Five Civilized Tribes. His career is noted in an introduction by Donald E. Worcester, a professor of history&nbsp;at Texas Christian University and well known for such books as <i>The Chisholm Trail: High Road of the Cattle Kingdom</i>."One of the best books ever written about the Southwest."&#x2014;Stanley Vestal (Stanley Vestal)</p><h2>The Metaphysical Club</h2><p><p><b><i>The Metaphysical Club </i>is the winner of the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for History.</b><br><b></b><br><b>A riveting, original book about the creation of modern American thought.</b></p><p>The Metaphysical Club was an informal group that met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1872, to talk about ideas. Its members included Oliver Well Holmes, Jr., future associate justice of the United States Supreme Court; William James, the father of modern American psychology; and Charles Sanders Peirce, logician, scientist, and the founder of semiotics. The Club was probably in existence for about nine months. No records were kept. The one thing we know that came out of it was an idea -- an idea about ideas. This book is the story of that idea.</p><p>Holmes, James, and Peirce all believed that ideas are not things "out there" waiting to be discovered but are tools people invent -- like knives and forks and microchips -- to make their way in the world. They thought that ideas are produced not by individuals, but by groups of individuals -- that ideas are social. They do not develop according to some inner logic of their own but are entirely depent -- like germs -- on their human carriers and environment. And they thought that the survival of any idea deps not on its immutability but on its adaptability.</p><p><i>The Metaphysical Club</i> is written in the spirit of this idea about ideas. It is not a history of philosophy but an absorbing narrative about personalities and social history, a story about America. It begins with the Civil War and s in 1919 with Justice Holmes's dissenting opinion in the case of U.S. v. Abrams-the basis for the constitutional law of free speech. The first four sections of the book focus on Holmes, James, Peirce, and their intellectual heir, John Dewey. The last section discusses some of the fundamental twentieth-century ideas they are associated with. This is a book about a way of thinking that changed American life."</p></p><p>If past is prologue, then <i>The Metaphysical Club</i> by Louis Menand may suggest an intellectual course for the United States in the 21st century. At least Menand, a frequent contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, thinks so. This enthralling study of Oliver Wendell Holmes, William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and John Dewey shows how these four men developed a philosophy of pragmatism following the Civil War, a period Menand likens to post-cold-war times. Together, "they were more responsible than any other group for moving American thought into the modern world." <p> Despite this potentially forbidding theme, <i>The Metaphysical Club</i> is not a dry tome for academics. Instead, it is a quadruple biography, a wonderfully told story of ideas that advances by turning these thinkers into characters and bringing them to life. Menand links them through the Metaphysical Club, a conversational club formed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1872. It lasted but a few months, and references to it appear only in Peirce's writings (its real significance seems rather limited), though Holmes and James were both members. (Dewey was much younger than these three, and more an heir than a contemporary.) It is difficult to describe in a sentence or two what they accomplished, though Menand takes a stab at it: "They helped put an end to the idea that the universe is an idea, that beyond the mundane business of making our way as best we can in a world shot through with contingency, there exists some order, invisible to us, whose logic we transgress at our peril." Academic freedom and cultural pluralism are just two of their legacies, and they are linchpins of democracy in a nonideological age, says Menand. </p><p> A book like this is necessarily idiosyncratic, yet at the same time this one is sweeping. It presents an accessible survey of intellectual life from roughly the end of the Civil War to the start of the cold war. Dozens of figures receive fascinating thumbnail sketches, from Ralph Waldo Emerson and Charles Darwin to Jane Addams and Eugene Debs. The result is a grand portrait of an age that will appeal to anyone with even a modest interest in the history of philosophy and ideas. <i>--John Miller</i></p><p><b>Louis Menand</b> is a professor of English at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i>, and has been a contributing editor of <i>The New York Review of Books</i> since 1994.

Lahr's utterly winning and incisive profiles probe some of the most compelling, elusive, and irresistible public personas of our time, among them: Woody Allen, David Mamet, Ingmar Bergman, Frank Sinatra, Roseanne, Irving Berlin, Bob Hope, Mike Nichols, Wallace Shawn, Arthur Miller, and Neil LaBute. In these, and the moving autobiographical portraits of his father, Bert Lahr, the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz, and his mother, a former Ziegfeld girl, Lahr charts the geography of fame.<p>Lahr's gift is to get inside both the art and the artist, to show how the work and the life intersect. He has had unusual access to his subjects who talk to him with rare candor. In prose "as lively as good conversation" (Robert Brustein), he arrives at truths of uncommon clarity, a claim seconded by Arthur Miller, who said that Lahr's essay on him is "by far the best thing about my stuff I've ever read". These very special profiles, the product of eight years' work at The New Yorker, deepen our understanding of their subjects and the culture that they profoundly reflect.

Now Helga Teiwes describes the development of this art form from early traditional styles to the action-style kachina dolls made popular in galleries throughout the world, and on to the kachina sculptures that have evolved in the last half of the 1980s.<br><br> Teiwes explains the role of the Katsina spirit in Hopi religion and that of the kachina doll&#x2014;the carved representation of a Katsina&#x2014;in the ritual and economic life of the Hopis. In tracing the history of the kachina doll in Hopi culture, she shows how these wooden figures have changed since carvers came to be influenced by their marketability among Anglos and how their carving has been characterized by increasingly refined techniques. Unique to this book are Teiwes's description of the most recent trends in kachina doll carving and her profiles of twenty-seven modern carvers, including such nationally known artists as Alvin James Makya and Cecil Calnimptewa. Enhancing the text are more than one hundred photographs, including twenty-five breathtaking color plates that bring to life the latest examples of this popular art form.</p><p>"This is not just another book about those cute but expensive dolls sold throughout the Southwest. Teiwes provides good background then proceeds into detail about recent developments in carving technique." &#x2014;<i>Books of the Southwest</i><br><br> "Teiwes is foremost a photographer, and her images of the artists at work and of the kachina sculptures are extraordinary. . . . Provides an excellent understanding of the secular contexts of contemporary Hopi kachina wood sculpture." &#x2014;<i>American Indian Culture and Research Journal</i><br><br> "Provides a clear example, easily grasped by most readers, of how Native Americans, even members of tribes rooted in centuries of tradition, adapt to modern technologies and opportunities." &#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br><br> "This book will be of great value in furthering our understanding of Hopi culture, for stimulating a rethinking of ethnic art, and for opening new horizons in the anthropology of tourism." &#x2014;<i>Asian Folklore Studies</i><br><br> "This book merits the attention of collectors and others enchanted by these works of art. . . . A pleasure to read." &#x2014;<i>Utah Historical Quarterly</i><br><br> "Absorbing reading for art lover and novice alike." &#x2014;<i>Chronicle-Journal/Times-News</i> (Canada)Hopi Indian Kachina dolls have evolved from a primitive religious symbol into a modern art form. Tracking this transition, Teiwes covers the history and cultural background of the Hopi Indians and their Kachina dolls, then turns to modern techniques and biographies of some contemporary Hopi artists. The author's admitted weakness in history shows in an uneven, choppy chapter, with frequent references to authorities. Nothing new is offered. The book is heavily illustrated, but the captions are ponderous, even longer than the text on the page. Still, the central color plates are particularly beautiful, and the book ends with quick and concise biographies of 27 Hopi artists.

At the start of <em>The Long Way Home</em>, the tenth in Penny&#x2019;s wildly popular Inspector Gamache series (you can buy &#x201c;Vive Gamache&#x201d; t-shirts and mugs from Penny&#x2019;s website), Gamache and his wife are finally at peace, mixing among the quirky, testy inhabitants of Three Pines. But recovery would make for a dull book, so trouble soon finds Gamache when his neighbor Clara seeks help finding her missing husband, who left town in a funk over Clara&#x2019;s success as an artist. In dragging Gamache from his reverie, Clara realizes she&#x2019;s awakened something in the ex-chief. There&#x2019;s a mythic heft to the story--man can&#x2019;t escape the past, or evil, or death. Though the descent into darkness, and the search for a &#x201c;sin-sick soul,&#x201d; at times felt overly ominous, I liked Penny&#x2019;s exploration of art, jealousy, and the lengths to which people will go to create something that matters. But, as with the entire series, it&#x2019;s Penny&#x2019;s chiseled characters that make this novel such a treat. Three Pines is a cozy, friendly place, but even amid the picturesque pines of southern Quebec, sin and sick souls are always lurking. <em>--Neal Thompson</em></p>LOUISE PENNY is the #1 New York Times and Globe and Mail bestselling author of nine previous Chief Inspector Armand Gamache novels.

Although Rudolf Steiner pointed out its healing aspects from the very beginning, it was not until 1921 that he gave a course of lectures describing a vital new application of eurythmy. To the assembled eurythmists and doctors, he presented what one participant described as &#x201c;a complete and detailed method of eurythmy therapy in which we could directly experience that, even today, the creative and therapeutic power of the word...is still at work.&#x201d; <p> Steiner&#x2019;s comprehensive lecture course, republished here in a thoroughly revised translation, describes the principles of therapeutic eurythmy and provides many specific exercises. Intended primarily for practicing eurythmists, these lectures also contain much material of special interest. Steiner reveals the intricacies of rhythmic interplay between human physiology and the life-forces in the world around us. He describes the qualities of language and the dynamism contained in the individual vowels and consonants, elucidating their relationship with eurythmy movements and human experience. Through such movements, individuals are able to access the healing etheric forces. </p><p> The exercises, which Steiner calls &#x201c;inner gymnastics,&#x201d; contain enormous potential for psychological and physiological well-being. Gaining increasingly wide recognition today, they complement conventional medicine and offer a therapeutic process for mind, soul and body. </p><p> This new edition of these important lectures includes an appendix with reminiscences by early eurythmists, as well as commentary from Dr. Walter Kugler, who revised and expanded the notes on which this edition is based. </p><p> A previous edition was published as <i>Curative Eurythmy.</i> </p><p> <i>Eurythmy Therapy</i> is a translation of <i>Heileurythmie,</i> Volume 315 of Rudolf Steiner's Complete Works.</p></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>The Man Who Loved Children</h2><p>Fictional Novel, Literary Fiction</p><p>Every family lives in an evolving story, told by all its members, inside a landscape of portentous events and characters.

Once again, the author's TV roots betray him as this book predictably dumbs-down its material.

Among his most recent are the <em>Dark Tower</em> novels,<em> Cell</em>, <em>From a Buick 8</em>, <em>Everything's Eventual</em>, <em>Hearts in Atlantis</em>, <em>The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon</em>, and <em>Bag of Bones</em>. He is the recipient of the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. He lives in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, novelist Tabitha King. </strong></p> <strong> </strong> <p><em>The Strain</em> trilogy opened with an authentic wow moment: a Boeing 777 arrives at JFK airport with all but four of the passengers dead in their seats. The flashlight beams of the first responders &#x201c;registered dully in the dead jewels of their open eyes.&#x201d; Not much later these corpses begin to rise from their morgue slabs, and a plague of blood-hungry predators overwhelms New York. The first hundred pages of <em>The Strain</em> is a sustained exercise in terror that held this reader in spellbound delight, because del Toro and Hogan write with crisp authenticity about both the fantastical (vampires) and the completely real (New York City, with all its odd nooks and crannies).</p> <p>What began in <em>The Strain</em> comes to a sublimely satisfying conclusion in <em>The Night Eternal</em>. Del Toro and Hogan have taken Dracula, the greatest vampire tale of them all, and deftly turned it inside out. In Stoker&#x2019;s novel, Bloodsucker Zero arrives in England on a sailing ship called the Demeter. As with the Regis Air 777, the Demeter is a ghost ship when it reaches port, the eponymous Count having snacked his way across the ocean. The difference is that Dracula is confronted by a heroic band of vampire-hunters who eventually drive him from England by using modern technology&#x2014;everything from diaries kept on wax recording cylinders to blood transfusions. In <em>The Strain</em> Trilogy, the body-hopping Master&#x2014;who arrives at JFK in the person of Polish nobleman Jusef Sardu&#x2014;uses the very technology that defeated his honorable forebear to destroy the civilized world. Big corporations are his tools; modern transportation serves to spread the vampire virus; nuclear weapons usher in a new era of pollution and atmospheric darkness.</p> <p>Only jolly old England escapes; the wily Brits have blown up the Chunnel early on, and remain relatively vampire-free. At moments like this, the reader senses del Toro and Hogan tucking their tongues in their cheeks and having a gleeful blast.</p> <p>When speaking of the New World Order in Henry the Sixth, Shakespeare has one of his characters say, &#x201c;The first thing we do, let&#x2019;s kill all the lawyers.&#x201d; As The <em>Night Eternal</em> opens, the Master (currently having traded the body of Sardu for that of rock star Gabriel Bolivar) doubles down on that, ordering his minions to kill not just those in the legal profession but all the CEOs, tycoons, intellectuals, rebels, and artists. &#x201c;Their execution was swift, public and brutal. Out they marched, the damned, out of the River House, the Dakota, the Beresford and their ilk...in a horrific pageant of carnage, they were disposed of.&#x201d;</p> <p>With the exception of heroic pawnbroker/scholar Abraham Setrakian (who almost destroyed the Master in Volume Two, <em>The Fall</em>), the winning cast of human characters from the previous novels are all present and accounted for: Nora Martinez, who has traded in her scientist&#x2019;s microscope for a silver sword; Vasily Fet, who now exterminates vampires instead of rats; Augustin &#x201c;Gus&#x201d; Elizade, once a gangbanger and now a hero of resistance. There&#x2019;s also the less-than-admirable but fascinating (in a repulsive way, it&#x2019;s true) Alfonso Creem, with his insatiable appetite and his vampire-repelling mouthful of silver teeth.</p> <p>And there&#x2019;s Eph Goodweather, the epidemiologist around whom all these others revolve. When <em>The Night Eternal</em> begins, two years after the Master has used nuclear weapons to create vampire-friendly darkness all over the planet, Eph has fallen on hard times. His undead ex-wife stalks him relentlessly (he is, after all, one of her &#x201c;Dear Ones&#x201d;), his son has become a rifle-toting, obsessive-compulsive acolyte of the Master, and Eph himself has started popping Vicodin and oxycodone. Nora has left him for Vasily Fet, and Eph is viewed with distrust by those who used to rally around him. Justifiable distrust; he keeps showing up late for meetings and vampire-killing gigs.</p> <p>Fet has managed to purchase a rogue nuke (it&#x2019;s wrapped in garbage bags and looks like a trashcan), and the resistance fighters have a sacred book that may&#x2014;if deciphered&#x2014;lead them to the Black Site where the Master&#x2019;s earthly life began. If they can destroy that holy soil, they believe the vampire plague will end.</p> <p>There&#x2019;s a certain amount of perhaps dispensable hugger-mugger about vampires in Rome and archangels in Sodom, but the main attractions here are the resistance fighters&#x2019; fierce dedication to their cause, and Eph Goodweather&#x2019;s slow and painful realization that if he destroys the Master, he may also destroy his son Zachary, the last person on earth he truly loves. Heroes of tragic dimension are rare in popular fiction, but Goodweather fills the bill nicely.</p> <p>After a small (and perhaps unavoidable&#x2014;see Tolkein&#x2019;s The Two Towers) letdown in <em>The Fall</em>, <em>The Strain</em> Trilogy comes to a rip-roaring conclusion in <em>The Night Eternal</em>. The action is non-stop, and the fantasy element is anchored in enough satisfying detail to make it believable. All the New York landmarks, such as Central Park&#x2019;s Belvedere Castle and The Cloisters, are real. And while you&#x2019;re discovering such essential vampire facts as the undead&#x2019;s inability to cross running water without human help, you&#x2019;ll also find out that the stone lions outside the New York Public Library have names: Patience and Fortitude. Plus, come on, admit it&#x2014;there&#x2019;s something about seeing vampires massing for an attack in a Wendy&#x2019;s parking lot that makes them more real. The devil&#x2019;s in the details, and this is one devilishly good read full of satisfying scares. --<em>Stephen King</em><br></p><em><p>The Earth lies shrouded in darkness...And it is our world no longer.</p></em><p>Two years have passed since the vampiric virus was first unleashed upon humanity&#x2014;and nuclear winter has cast the poisoned world into eternal night. The remnants of the living who were not turned have been subjugated&#x2014;with many imprisoned in camps to be bred and bled for the sustenance of the Master's vast vampire army.</p><p>Yet the fight continues. Dr. Eph Goodweather, of the Centers for Disease Control's biological threats team; his former colleague and lover, Dr. Nora Martinez; and the exterminator Vasiliy Fet lead a band of freedom fighters aided by Mr. Quinlan, the half-breed offspring of the Master, who now is bent on revenge. At humankind's darkest hour, one of them may hold the key to salvation. But a traitor is among them. And who will be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice so that others may live?</p></p><h2>Library Book</h2><p>A New York Times Book of the Year, 2018A dazzling love letter to a beloved institution - our libraries.After moving to Los Angeles, Susan Orlean became fascinated by a mysterious local crime that has gone unsolved since it was carried out on the morning of 29 April 1986: who set fire to the Los Angeles Public Library, ultimately destroying more than 400,000 books, and perhaps even more perplexing, why? With her characteristic humour, insight and compassion, Orlean uses this terrible event as a lens through which to tell the story of all libraries - their history, their meaning and their uncertain future as they adapt and redefine themselves in a digital world. Filled with heart, passion and extraordinary characters, The Library Book discusses the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives.</p><p></p><h2>Water and Dreams: An Essay on the Imagination of Matter (Bachelard Translation Series)</h2><p>Gaston Bachelard, master dreamer of the elements, animates the waters of the soul with his stirring, fluid imagination. With the subtlety of a poet, he ranges from the surface of water with its reflective narcissism to the very depths where water flows into death. Clear waters, deep water, the Charon Complex, water in combination with other elements, maternal waters, water&#39;s morality, violent water, water&#39;s voice.</p><p>THE BACHELARD TRANSLATIONS are the inspiration of Joanne H. Stroud, who in 1981 contracted with Jos� Corti to publish in English the untranslated works of Bachelard on the imagination through the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture, Dallas, Texas.<br><br> <p>Gaston Bachelard is acclaimed as one of the most significant modern French thinkers. From 1929 to 1962 he authored twenty-three books addressing his dual concerns, the philosophy of science and the analysis of the imagination of matter. The influence of his thought can be felt in all disciplines of the humanities - art, architecture, literature, language, poetics, philosophy, and depth psychology. His teaching career included posts at the College de Bar-sur-Aube, the University of Dijon, and from 1940 to 1962 the chair of history and philosophy of science at the Sorbonne. One of the amphitheaters of the Sorbonne is called "L'Amphi Gaston Bachelard," an honor Bachelard shared with Descartes and Richelieu. He received the Grand Prix National Lettres in 1961-one of only three philosophers ever to have achieved this honor.

Anabaptist spirituality has been described as &#39;both Catholic and Protestant&#39;, a sixteenth-century ascetic lay reform movement inspired both by currents of pre-Reformation devotion to Christ and the Reformation call to return to Scripture. Because of their insistence on adult baptism followers - often illiterate artisans and peasants with no formal theological education - met widespread persecution. Arnold Snyder&#39;s sympathetic study draws on court records to give an intimate glimpse into their convictions, practices and spirituality. As well as inspiring such groups as the Mennonites, the Amish and various groups of Brethren and Baptists, Anabaptist ideas have profoundly influenced individuals and movements throughout the churches into modern times. C.Arnold Snyder is the editor and author of several books and scholarly articles on the Anabaptist tradition.

Reprint.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell Marsh <br> 1900 - 1949 <br><br> Born in Atlanta in 1900, Margaret Mitchell grew up surrounded by relatives who told endless tales of the Civil War and Reconstruction. She knew those who were relics of a de-stroyed culture, and those who had put aside gentility for survival. Her mother instilled in her that education was her only security. She attended Smith College but had to come home when her mother fell ill. After her mother's death, Margaret resolved that she had to make a home for her father and brother, so she left college and returned to Atlanta. <br><br> In 1923, she became a feature writer for the Atlanta Journal, and in 1925, she married John Marsh, a public relations officer for Georgia Power. She found most of her assignments unfulfilling, and she soon left to try writing fiction more to her own taste. Her own harshest critic, she would not try to get her work published. She began to write Gone with the Wind in 1926, while recovering from an automobile accident. Over the next eight years she painstakingly researched for historical accuracy. <br><br>She accumulated thousands of pages of manuscript. Here is how she later described her life's labor: "When I look back on these last years of struggling to find time to write between deaths in the family, illness in the family and among friends which lasted months and even years, childbirths (not my own), divorces and neuroses among friends, my own ill health and four fine auto accidents ... it all seems like a nightmare. I wouldn't tackle it again for anything. Just as soon as I sat down to write, somebody I loved would decide to have their gall-bladder removed. ... " <br><br> In 1934, an editor from Macmillan's Publishers came to Atlanta seeking new authors. He was referred to John and Margaret Marsh as people who knew Atlanta's literary scene. She steered him to several prospects, but didn't mention her own work. A friend told him that she was writing a novel, but she denied it. On the night before he was to leave Atlanta, she appeared at his hotel-room door with her still imperfect, mountainous manuscript and left it with him for better or for worse. <br><br> The rest of the story is well-known"Fascinating and unforgettable! A remarkable book, a spectacular book, a book that will not be forgotten!" -- "Chicago Tribune"<br><br>"I first read "Gone with the Wind" in grade school--a boy of the upper South who'd seen the great movie and felt compelled to learn what lay behind it, all thousand-plus pages worth. No page disappointed me. What other American novel surpasses its eagerness to tell a great story of love and war; what characters equal the cantankerous passions of Scarlett and Rhett? Even Scott Fitzgerald spoke well of it. What more could I ask, even seven decades later?" -- Reynolds Price<br><br>"GWTW is an indelible portrait of a unique time and place, American's greatest political and moral conflict, and the myths that surround it -- an all absorbing spectacle of a read even for postmodern readers. Mitchell vividly portrays the disillusionment and devastation of war, the ignorance of the uninitiated, and the transformation of arrogance into tenacity that shaped the first "new South." All the details of history and place come together as a rich backdrop for those unforgettable characters: shallow and selfish Scarlett, sincere Melanie, moony-eyed Ashley, and the sage, pragmatic, dashing, and rakish Rhett Butler--the most enduring heartthrob of American literature has produced. I'd reread the book for the thrill of Rhett alone!" -- Darnell Arnoult, author of "Sufficient Grace"<br><br>"In 1936 I was in E.M. Daggett Junior High in Ft. Worth, Texas. By some chance I was able to read "Gone with the Wind" early on. Then and now, I found it one of the great experiences of a young life. I still list it as one of my 10 favorite books." -- Liz Smith, nationally syndicated columnist<br><br>"Beyond a doubt one of the most remarkable first novels produced by an American writer. It is also one of the best." -- "The New York Times"<br><br>"Not just a great love story, "Gone with the Wind" is one of the most powerful anti-war novels ever written. Told from the standpoint of the women left behind, author Margaret Mitchell brilliantly illustrates the heartbreaking and devastating effects of war on the land and its people." -- Fannie Flagg, Academy Award nominated-author<br><br>"The best novel to have ever come out of the South...it is unsurpassed in the whole of American writing." -- "The Washington Post"<br><br>"Let's say you've read "Gone with the Wind" at least twice, and seen the movie over and again. So, here's a thought. Buy this handsome paperback edition, just for Pat Conroy's preface. This passionate, nearly breathless love letter is a Song of Solomon to Margaret Mitchell, Scarlett O'Hara, and Conroy's beautiful, GTW-obsessed mother. Indeed, his luminous preface packs a durable wallop, just like the epic Pulitzer prize-winning work that inspires it." -- Jan Karon, author of "The Mitford Years" series<br><br>"In my own personal life, I find many similarities to Scarlett's: The whole 17-inch waist thing notwithstanding, I do love a barbecue, both for the food and the men--I have been known to "eat like a field hand and gobble like a hawg"--I admit that at least on one occasion I may have feigned interest in some guy to further my own interests--I have fought tooth, toenail and tirelessly for my family--I learn slow but I learn good--and even so, I still adore the prospect of dealing with most things...Tomorrow." -- Jill Conner Browne, The Sweet Potato Queen, bestselling author of "The Sweet Potato Queens' First Big-Ass Novel"<br><br>""Gone with the Wind" is one of those rare books that we never forget. We read it when we're young and fall in love with the characters, then we watch the film and read the book again and watch the film again and never get tired of revisiting an era that is the most important in our history. Rhett and Scarlet and Melanie and Ashley and Big Sam and Mammy and Archie the convict are characters who always remain with us, in the same way that Twain's characters do. No one ever forgets the scene when Scarlet wanders among the wounded in the Atlanta train yard; no one ever forgets the moment Melanie and Scarlet drag the body of the dead Federal soldier down the staircase, a step at a time. "Gone with the Wind" is an epic story. Anyone who has not read it has missed one of the greatest literary experiences a reader can have." -- James Lee Burke, bestselling author of "The Tin Roof Blowdown "</p><h2>Hostile Waters</h2><p>The true story of sixty Russians who gave their lives to defuse an aging Soviet ballistic missile submarine off the coast of North Carolina in 1986 is the basis of an HBO movie due to air in July 1997.

In 1986, one of these Soviet vessels nearly suffered a meltdown not far from Bermuda in what might have been a worse-than-Chernobyl accident. <i>Hostile Waters</i> tells this story more like a novel than a textbook, but also makes good use of declassified material and personal interviews.

She described this as &#34;a human project&#34; about learning. In the book, she describes her experiences as a man in strip clubs, on dates, in a monastery, and as part of a men&#39;s support group. In order to effectively pose as a male, Vincent acquired a buzz cut and flattened her chest using a small sports bra. She also hired a makeup artist to fake a five o&#39;clock shadow and trained for months to imitate a deeper male voice. Vincent joined a men&#39;s bowling team, where she says &#34;[the men] just took me in ... no questions asked.&#34; She eventually became friends with them, even coming along to strip clubs and dating women who had no idea of her true gender. She later revealed that she was actually female to the men, who &#34;took it well.&#34; Vincent also recorded her book as a talking book for Penguin Highbridge.</p><p><b>Praise for Norah Vincent:</b><br> "Norah Vincent is a true freethinker and independent journalist in the European manner, challenging prevailing assumptions in academe, politics, and media. Her work has always had a bold skepticism and energy.

Gennady Spirin elegantly depicts the events leading up to and following the crucifixion, from Christ's entry into Jerusalem to the Last Supper to the descent of the Holy Spirit on the disciples. In the tradition of the great masters before him, Mr. Spirin pays close attention to symbolic and religious detail. He portrays Jesus as the light that came into a somber world of sin, and ends the book with the promise of the resurrection. </p><p>Gennady Spirin has been described in the Boston Globe as an artist who "truly represents the picture book as an object of art." Drawing on his Orthodox Christian faith, he delivers a work of dignity and beauty.</p></p><p>As he did with <i>The Christmas Story</i>, Gennady Spirin provides a lavish artistic accompaniment to excerpts from the King James Bible. This time he offers tribute to the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. Adding to the drama and symbolism of the story, Spirin drapes Jesus in a flowing, ivory robe that enhances the radiance of Christ himself, who seems to glow from the core of his being. As readers follow the shining Jesus through these ornate pages, the masses, the disciples, the enemies, and all the scenery is cast in the more aged and muted earthly colors of dusty beige, shadowy gray, burnt clay, and old gold. Only the angel of comfort, sent from heaven on Jesus' dark night of the soul, is able to match the light of Christ. <p> Although Spirin's tempera and watercolor illustrations are unequivocally inspired and penetrating, children younger than 8 years old may find it difficult to follow the obtuse, unfamiliar gospels of Matthew, Luke, and John. The crucifixion--with its appropriately dark and disturbing illustrations--commands especially the adult reader to offer plenty of comfort and discussion. Even the resurrection pages are sobering--until the final triumphant spread where we see Christ peacefully reigning among a host of trumpeting angels. From the language itself, many young children might find it impossible to glean the redemption and glory of this story without some extensive interpretation. While this kind of interactive reading is probably a good thing for children, it requires an astute and sensitive adult reader. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Gennady Spirin was born on Christmas Day in 1948 in a small city near Moscow.

Here, in ten powerful pieces first published in <i>The New Yorker,</i> he recalls the path that terror in the Middle East has taken, from the rise of al-Qaeda in the 1990s to the recent beheadings of reporters and aid workers by ISIS.<br> <i><br>The Terror Years</i> draws on several articles he wrote while researching <i>The Looming Tow</i>er<i>,</i> as well as many that he&#x2019;s written since, following where and how al-Qaeda and its core cultlike beliefs have morphed and spread. They include a portrait of the &#x201c;man behind bin Laden,&#x201d; Ayman al-Zawahiri, and the tumultuous Egypt he helped spawn; an indelible impression of Saudi Arabia, a kingdom of silence under the control of the religious police; the Syrian film industry, at the time compliant at the edges but already exuding a feeling of the barely masked fury that erupted into civil war; the 2006&#x2013;11 Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza, a study in the disparate value of human lives. Other chapters examine al-Qaeda as it forms a master plan for its future, experiences a rebellion from within the organization, and spins off a growing web of worldwide terror. The American response is covered in profiles of two FBI agents and the head of the intelligence community. The book ends with a devastating piece about the capture and slaying by ISIS of four American journalists and aid workers, and our government&#x2019;s failed response.<br> &nbsp;<br>On the fifteenth anniversary of 9/11, <i>The Terror Years</i> is at once a unifying recollection of the roots of contemporary Middle Eastern terrorism, a study of how it has grown and metastasized, and, in the scary and moving epilogue, a cautionary tale of where terrorism might take us yet.&nbsp;</p><p><b>LAWRENCE WRIGHT</b> is a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> and the author of eight previous books of nonfiction, including <i>In the New World,</i> <i>Remembering Satan,</i> <i>The Looming Tower,</i> <i>Going Clear,</i> and <i>Thirteen Days in September,</i> and one novel, <i>God&#x2019;s Favorite</i>.

Predator drones were circling the skies and American troops were sweeping through the mountains. The war had begun six months earlier, and by now the fighting had narrowed down to the ragged eastern edge of the country. Regional warlords had been bought off, the borders supposedly sealed. For twelve days, American and Coalition forces had been bombing the nearby Shah-e-Kot Valley and systematically destroying the cave complexes in the al-Qaeda stronghold. And yet the horsemen were riding unhindered toward Pakistan.<br><br>They came to the village of a local militia commander named Gula Jan, whose long beard and black turban might have signaled that he was a Taliban sympathizer. &#x201c;I saw a heavy, older man, an Arab, who wore dark glasses and had a white turban,&#x201d; Jan said four days later. &#x201c;He was dressed like an Afghan, but he had a beautiful coat, and he was with two other Arabs who had masks on.&#x201d; The man in the beautiful coat dismounted and began talking in a polite and humorous manner. He asked Jan and an Afghan companion about the location of American and Northern Alliance troops. &#x201c;We are afraid we will encounter them,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Show us the right way.&#x201d;<br><br>While the men were talking, Jan slipped away to examine a poster that had been dropped into the area by American airplanes. It showed a photograph of a man in a white turban and glasses. His face was broad and meaty, with a strong, prominent nose and full lips. His untrimmed beard was gray at the temples and ran in milky streaks below his chin. On his high forehead, framed by the swaths of his turban, was a darkened callus formed by many hours of prayerful prostration. His eyes reflected the sort of decisiveness one might expect in a medical man, but they also showed a measure of serenity that seemed oddly out of place. Jan was looking at a wanted poster for Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, who had a price of $25 million on his head.<br><br>Jan returned to the conversation. The man he now believed to be Zawahiri said to him, &#x201c;May God bless you and keep you from the enemies of Islam. Try not to tell them where we came from and where we are going.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a telephone number on the wanted poster, but Gula Jan did not have a phone. Zawahiri and the masked Arabs disappeared into the mountains.<br><br>in june of 2001, two terrorist organizations, al-Qaeda and the Egyptian Islamist group al-Jihad, formally merged into one. The name of the new entity&#x2014;Qaeda al-Jihad&#x2014;reflects the long and interdependent history of these two groups. Although Osama bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda, was the public face of Islamic terrorism, the members of al-Jihad and its guiding figure, Ayman al-Zawahiri, provided the backbone of the larger organization&#x2019;s leadership and was responsible for much of the planning of the terrorist operations against the United States, from the assault on American soldiers in Somalia in 1993, and the bombings of the American embassies in East Africa in 1998 and of the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11.<br><br>Bin Laden and Zawahiri were bound to discover each other among the radical Islamists who were drawn to Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in 1979. For one thing, both were very much modern men. Bin Laden, who was in his early twenties, was already an international businessman; Zawahiri, six years older, was a surgeon from a notable Egyptian family. They were both members of the educated classes, intensely pious, quiet-spoken, and politically stifled by the regimes in their own countries. Each man filled a need in the other. Bin Laden, an idealist with vague political ideas, sought direction, and Zawahiri, a seasoned propagandist, supplied it. &#x201c;Bin Laden had followers, but they weren&#x2019;t organized,&#x201d; recalls Essam Deraz, an Egyptian filmmaker who made several documentaries about the Soviet-Afghan War. &#x201c;The people with Zawahiri had extraordinary capabilities&#x2014;doctors, engineers, soldiers. They had experience in secret work. They knew how to organize themselves and create cells. And they became the leaders.&#x201d;<br><br>The goal of al-Jihad was to overthrow the civil government of Egypt and impose a theocracy that might eventually become a model for the entire Arab world; however, years of guerrilla warfare had left the group shattered and bankrupt. For Zawahiri, bin Laden was a savior&#x2014;rich and generous, with nearly limitless resources, but also pliable and politically unformed. &#x201c;Bin Laden had an Islamic frame of reference, but he didn&#x2019;t have anything against the Arab regimes,&#x201d; Montasser al-Zayat, a lawyer for many of the Islamists, told me. &#x201c;When Ayman met bin Laden, he created a revolution inside him.&#x201d;<br><br>five miles south of the chaos of Cairo is a quiet middle-class suburb called Maadi. A consortium of Egyptian Jewish financiers, intending to create a kind of English village amid the mango and guava plantations and Bedouin settlements on the eastern bank of the Nile, began selling lots in the first decade of the twentieth century. The developers regulated everything, from the height of the garden fences to the color of the shutters on the grand villas that lined the streets. They planted eucalyptus trees to repel flies and mosquitoes, and gardens to perfume the air with the fragrance of roses and jasmine and bougainvillea. Many of the early settlers were British military officers and civil servants, whose wives started garden clubs and literary salons; they were followed by Jewish families, who by the end of the Second World War made up nearly a third of Maadi&#x2019;s population. After the war, Maadi evolved into a community of expatriate Europeans, American businessmen and missionaries, and a certain type of Egyptian&#x2014;typically one who spoke French at dinner and followed the cricket matches.<br><br>The center of this cosmopolitan community was the Maadi Sporting Club. Founded at a time when Egypt was occupied by the British, the club was unusual for admitting not only Jews but Egyptians. Community business was often conducted on the all-sand eighteen-hole golf course, with the Giza Pyramids and the palmy Nile as a backdrop. As high tea was served to the British in the lounge, Nubian waiters bearing icy glasses of Nescaf� glided among the pashas and princesses sunbathing at the pool. High-stepping flamingos waded through the lilies in the garden pond. The Maadi Club became an ideal expression of the founders&#x2019; vision of Egypt&#x2014;sophisticated, safe, secular, and ethnically diverse, though still married to British notions of class.<br><br>The careful regulations could not withstand the pressure of Cairo&#x2019;s burgeoning population, and in the late 1960s another Maadi took root. &#x201c;We called its residents the &#x2018;Road 9 crowd,&#x2019; &#x201d; Samir Raafat, a journalist who has written a history of the suburb, told me. &#x201c;It was very much &#x2018;them&#x2019; and &#x2018;us.&#x2019; &#x201d; Road 9 runs beside train tracks that separate the tony side of Maadi from the baladi district&#x2014;the native part of town. Here donkey carts clop along unpaved streets past peanut vendors and yam salesmen hawking their wares and fly-studded carcasses hanging in butcher shops. There is also, on this side of town, a narrow slice of the middle class, composed mainly of teachers and low-level bureaucrats who were drawn to the suburb by the cleaner air and the dream of crossing the tracks and being welcomed into the club.<br><br>In 1960, Dr. Rabie al-Zawahiri and his wife, Umayma, moved from Heliopolis to Maadi. Rabie and Umayma belonged to two of the most prominent families in Egypt. The Zawahiri (pronounced za-wah-iri) clan was creating a medical dynasty. Rabie was a professor of pharmacology at Ain Shams University in Cairo. His brother was a highly regarded dermatologist and an expert on venereal diseases. The tradition they established continued into the next generation; a 1995 obituary in a Cairo newspaper for one of their relatives, Kashif al-Zawahiri, mentioned forty-six members of the family, thirty-one of whom were doctors or chemists or pharmacists; among the others were an ambassador, a judge, and a member of parliament.<br><br>The Zawahiri name, however, was associated above all with religion. In 1929, Rabie&#x2019;s uncle Mohammed al-Ahmadi al-Zawahiri became the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, the thousand-year-old university in the heart of Old Cairo, which is still the center of Islamic learning in the Middle East. The leader of that institution enjoys a kind of papal status in the Muslim world, and Imam Mohammed is still remembered as one of the university&#x2019;s great modernizers. Rabie&#x2019;s father and grandfather were Al-Azhar scholars as well.<br><br>Umayma Azzam, Rabie&#x2019;s wife, was from a clan that was equally distinguished but wealthier and also a little notorious. Her father, Dr. Abd al-Wahab Azzam, was the president of Cairo University and the founder and director of King Saud University, in Riyadh. He had also served at various times as the Egyptian ambassador to Pakistan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. Another relative was secretary-general of the Arab League. &#x201c;From the first parliament, more than a hundred and fifty years ago, there have been Azzams in government,&#x201d; Umayma&#x2019;s uncle Mahfouz Azzam, who is an attorney in Maadi, told me. &#x201c;And we were always in the opposition.&#x201d; Mahfouz was a fervent Egyptian nationalist in his youth. &#x201c;I was in prison when I was fifteen years old,&#x201d; he said proudly. &#x201c;They condemned me for making what they called a &#x2018;coup d&#x2019;�tat.&#x2019; &#x201d; In 1945, Mahfouz was arrested again, in a roundup of militants after the assassination of Prime Minister Ahmad Mahir. &#x201c;I myself was going to do what Ayman has done,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Despite their pedigrees, Rabie and Umayma settled into an apartment on Street 100, on the baladi side of the tracks. Later, they rented a duplex at No. 10, Street 154, near the train station. High society held no interest for them. At a time when public displays of religious zeal were rare&#x2014;and in Maadi almost unheard of&#x2014;the couple was religious but not overtly pious. Umayma went about unveiled. There were more churches than mosques in the neighborhood, and a thriving synagogue.<br><br>Children quickly filled the Zawahiri home. The first, Ayman and a twin sister, Umnya, were born on June 19, 1951. The twins were extremely bright, and were at the top of their classes all the way through medical school. A younger sister, Heba, also became a doctor. The two other children, Mohammed and Hussein, trained as architects.<br><br>Obese, bald, and slightly cross-eyed, Rabie al-Zawahiri had a reputation as being eccentric and absentminded, and yet he was beloved by his students and by the neighborhood children. He spent most of his time in the laboratory or in his private medical clinic. Professor Zawahiri&#x2019;s research occasionally took him to Czechoslovakia, at a time when few Egyptians traveled, because of currency restrictions. He always returned laden with toys for the children. He sometimes found time to take them to the movies at the Maadi Sporting Club, which were open for nonmembers. Young Ayman loved the cartoons and Disney films, which played three nights a week on an outdoor screen. In the summer, the family went to a beach in Alexandria. Life on a professor&#x2019;s salary was constricted, especially with five ambitious children to educate. The Zawahiris never owned a car until Ayman was out of medical school. To economize, the Zawahiris kept hens behind the house for fresh eggs, and the professor bought oranges and mangoes by the crate, which he pressed upon the children as a natural source of vitamin C. <br><br>Umayma Azzam was a wonderful cook, famous for her kunafa&#x2014;a pastry of shredded phyllo filled with cheese and nuts and drenched in orange-blossom syrup. She inherited several substantial plots of farmland in Giza and the Fayyum Oasis from her father, which provided her with a modest income. Ayman and his mother shared a love of literature. &#x201c;She always memorized the poems that Ayman sent her,&#x201d; Mahfouz Azzam told me. Although Ayman maintained the Zawahiri medical tradition, he was actually closer in temperament to his mother&#x2019;s side of the family. &#x201c;The Zawahiris are professors and scientists, and they hate to speak of politics,&#x201d; Azzam said. &#x201c;Ayman told me that his love of medicine was probably inherited. But politics was also in his genes.&#x201d;<br><br>for anyone living in Maadi in the fifties and sixties, there was one defining social standard: membership in the Maadi Sporting Club. &#x201c;The whole activity of Maadi revolved around the club,&#x201d; Samir Raafat, the historian of the suburb, told me one afternoon as he drove me around the neighborhood. &#x201c;If you were not a member, why even live in Maadi?&#x201d; The Zawahiris never joined, which meant that Ayman would be curtained off from the center of power and status. &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t mainstream Maadi; he was totally marginal Maadi,&#x201d; Raafat said. &#x201c;The Zawahiris were a conservative family. You would never see them in the club, holding hands, playing bridge. We called them saidis. Literally, the word refers to someone from a district in Upper Egypt, but we use it to mean something like &#x2018;hick.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>At one end of Maadi, surrounded by green playing fields and tennis courts, is Victoria College, a private British-built preparatory school for boys. The students attended classes in coats and ties. One of its best-known graduates was a talented cricket player named Michel Chalhub; after he became a film actor, he took the name Omar Sharif. Edward Said, the Palestinian scholar and author, attended the school, along with Jordan&#x2019;s future king, Hussein. <br><br>Zawahiri, however, attended the state secondary school, a modest low-slung building behind a green gate, on the opposite side of the suburb. &#x201c;It was the hoodlum school, the other end of the social spectrum,&#x201d; Raafat told me. The students of the two schools existed in different worlds, never meeting each other even in sports. Whereas Victoria College measured itself by European standards, the state school had its back to the West. Inside the green gate, the schoolyard was run by bullies and the classrooms by tyrants. A physically vulnerable young boy such as Ayman had to create strategies to survive. <br><br>Ayman&#x2019;s childhood pictures show him with a round face, a wary gaze, and a flat and unsmiling mouth. He was a bookworm and hated contact sports&#x2014;he thought they were &#x201c;inhumane,&#x201d; according to his uncle Mahfouz. From an early age, he was devout, and he often attended prayers at the Hussein Sidki Mosque, an unimposing annex of a large apartment building; the mosque was named after a famous actor who renounced his profession because it was ungodly. No doubt Ayman&#x2019;s interest in religion seemed natural in a family with so many distinguished religious scholars, but it added to his image of being soft and otherworldly.<br><br>Although Ayman was an excellent student, he often seemed to be daydreaming in class. &#x201c;He was a mysterious character, closed and introverted,&#x201d; Zaki Mohammed Zaki, a Cairo journalist who was a classmate of his, told me. &#x201c;He was extremely intelligent, and all the teachers respected him. He had a very systematic way of thinking, like that of an older guy. He could understand in five minutes what it would take other students an hour to understand. I would call him a genius.&#x201d;</p><h2>Men of War: The American Soldier in Combat at Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, and Iwo Jima</h2><p><b>In the grand tradition of John Keegan&#x2019;s enduring classic <i>The Face of Battle </i>comes a searing, unforgettable chronicle of war through the eyes of the American soldiers who fought in three of our most iconic battles: Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, and Iwo Jima.</b><br><br> This is not a book about how great generals won their battles, nor is it a study in grand strategy. <i>Men of War</i> is instead a riveting, visceral, and astonishingly original look at ordinary soldiers under fire.<br><br> Drawing on an immense range of firsthand sources from the battlefield, Alexander Rose begins by re-creating the lost and alien world of eighteenth-century warfare at Bunker Hill, the bloodiest clash of the War of Independence&#x2014;and reveals why the American militiamen were so lethally effective against the oncoming waves of British troops. Then, focusing on Gettysburg, Rose describes a typical Civil War infantry action, vividly explaining what Union and Confederate soldiers experienced before, during, and after combat. Finally, he shows how in 1945 the Marine Corps hurled itself with the greatest possible violence at the island of Iwo Jima, where nearly a third of all Marines killed in World War II would die. As Rose demonstrates, the most important factor in any battle is the human one: At Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, and Iwo Jima, the American soldier, as much as any general, proved decisive.<br><br> To an unprecedented degree,<i> Men of War </i>brings home the reality of combat and, just as important, its aftermath in the form of the psychological and medical effects on veterans. As such, the book makes a critical contribution to military history by narrowing the colossal gulf between the popular understanding of wars and the experiences of the soldiers who fight them.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Men of War</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A tour de force . . . strikingly vivid, well-observed, and compulsively readable.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Daily Beast</i> </b><br><br>&#x201c;Military history at its best . . .

His writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times,</i> <i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> <i>The</i> <i>Washington Post,</i> and other publications.1. Introduction<br><br>The most curious thing about Bunker Hill is that, despite its iconic status in American history, it was in some respects quite a minor affair. Anywhere between 1,500 and 3,500 American militiamen&#x2014;�their strength varied over the course of the day, as men left and reinforcements arrived&#x2014;�fought roughly 2,400 to 3,000 British soldiers over the course of a few hours one pleasant afternoon on June 17, 1775, on a small peninsula across from Boston. By way of contrast, a more typical conflict of the era was the War of the Bavarian Succession between Austria and Prussia. In 1778&#x2014;�contemporaneous with the struggle in the American colonies&#x2014;�Prussia, the least populous and the poorest of the European powers, fielded no fewer than 160,000 troops.1<br><br>Yet these dry statistics belie Bunker Hill&#x2019;s consequence. As the Annual Register would briskly conclude near the end of the Revolution, &#x201c;Most of these actions would in other wars be considered but as skirmishes of little account [though] it is by such skirmishes that the fate of America must be necessarily decided. They are therefore as important as battles in which an hundred thousand men are drawn up on each side.&#x201d;2<br><br>To its participants the battle certainly did not feel like a &#x201c;skirmish&#x201d;: Bunker Hill holds the wretched distinction of being the bloodiest clash of the War of Independence. &#x201c;I can only say from the oldest soldiers here,&#x201d; wrote the newly arrived Lieutenant William Feilding, &#x201c;that it was the hottest fire they ever saw.&#x201d;3 By day&#x2019;s end, almost half the British troops engaged would be dead or wounded. &#x201c;Tho&#x2019; Masters of the Field of Battle,&#x201d; one contemporary grimly judged, &#x201c;the King&#x2019;s Troops are much the greatest Sufferers.&#x201d;4 Another determined that the British army could now be divided into three: &#x201c;The first company is under ground; the second is above ground; the third is in the hospital.&#x201d;5 American losses were relatively small.<br><br>Before Bunker Hill, few believed that part-�time militiamen could stand, face, and fight a professional army. Yet they did, and by acquitting themselves so magnificently demonstrated that the American cause was a viable and worthy enterprise. Which means we must ask: Who were they? How did they do it? And what was it like to fight at Bunker Hill?<br><br>2. The Battle<br><br>First, a summary of what happened. Late at night on June 16, 1775, a detachment of American militiamen commanded by General Israel Putnam sneakily took possession of Bunker Hill, a modest rise on the Charlestown peninsula. This triangular piece of land was attached to the Massachusetts mainland by a narrow strip called Charlestown Neck, and it jutted out between the Mystic and Charles Rivers to face Boston, where the British were holed up. Early the next morning, the British realized that these Americans were so close to Boston that they could bombard the city with cannon, but far worse, that Colonel William Prescott&#x2019;s men were now building an earthen &#x201c;Redoubt&#x201d; (a type of small fort) atop Breed&#x2019;s Hill, which was nearer even than Bunker. Once their work was done, the Americans would be so securely ensconced that it would be exceedingly difficult to dislodge them. Accordingly, British troops under General Sir William Howe were transported across the bay to the peninsula, where they prepared to assault the enemy before time ran out. Additionally, after the Americans had been put to the sword, Howe intended to advance on Cambridge, where the main American forces under General Artemas Ward were stationed. If all went well, the rebellion would be over by close of play, either that day or the next.<br><br>Meanwhile, fresh American militia units under Colonel John Stark had arrived to support Prescott, now grievously exposed at Breed&#x2019;s Hill. Instead of reinforcing him directly, however, they marched to Bunker Hill, which guarded the vulnerable Neck against a British attack from the rear. At the foot of Bunker Hill they hurriedly assembled a long defensive structure termed the &#x201c;Rail Fence,&#x201d; which faced the spot where the British were assembling in preparation for the imminent clash. On the &#x201c;Beach&#x201d; directly below and perpendicular to his position, Stark built a low stone wall to prevent a surprise flank attack. Despite these precautions, Prescott had by this time realized the danger he was in and ordered his men to dig a trench, or breastwork, extending from the redoubt&#x2019;s walls to cover a weak spot between his position and that of Stark.<br><br>The British were now confronted by firmly entrenched defenders, making nonsense of their original plan. Even so, come what may, the Americans had to be destroyed. Howe divided his force into two divisions, the right under him, the left under Robert Pigot. Howe would attack the rail fence and the beach while Pigot assaulted Prescott&#x2019;s redoubt at Breed&#x2019;s Hill.<br><br>Following a series of bloody attacks Howe&#x2019;s wing stalled but Pigot&#x2019;s managed to break through Prescott&#x2019;s defenses. A vicious bout of hand-� to-�hand combat sent the militiamen fleeing for the safety of Bunker Hill. Their positions lost, the Americans retreated across the Neck and set up defensive positions on the mainland. Some of the British gamely tried to pursue the enemy, but physical exhaustion and the sheer scale of Howe&#x2019;s losses convinced him to halt for the night. The battle of Bunker Hill was over, but the War of Independence had only just begun.<br><br>3. The Redoubt, Part One<br><br>The militiamen came garbed for battle as they did for work&#x2014;�as farmers and artisans.1 Some even had on the same leather aprons they wore in their shops.2 For the most part, the New England militia units reflected their respectable rural environments. In Captain Hutchins&#x2019;s company, two-�thirds listed their occupations as &#x201c;husbandmen&#x201d;&#x2014;�that is, farmers&#x2014;�with most of the rest making a decent living as carpenters, cobblers, tailors, millers, and the like.3 Many outfits also had within their ranks former slaves, maybe a couple of itinerants, the odd Native American perhaps, but the militiamen who fought at Bunker Hill for the most part owned property of some sort&#x2014;�an average-�sized farm, say&#x2014;�and most of those who did not were the sons of men who did.<br><br>Many wore homespun shirts, sometimes made of canvas but of linen or flax in the summer, that were &#x201c;a kind of loose frock, reaching half way down the thighs, with large sleeves, open before, and so wide as to lap over a foot or more when belted.&#x201d;4 Their gaiters or stockings were tanned a dead-�leaf color in vats, and their feet were clad in &#x201c;cowhide shoes ornamented by large buckles, while not a pair of boots graced the company,&#x201d; as one octogenarian recollected it decades later. Many had on weather-�beaten broad-�brimmed hats often turned up on three sides to form a sloppy tricorne, sometimes complemented by a sprig of green or a homemade cockade; around their necks they tied an off-�colored neckerchief or stock.5<br><br>It was hard, perhaps impossible, to distinguish the men sartorially from their officers&#x2014;�a profound difference to European military custom. Of the ten richest men in Lexington, for example, no fewer than eight were content to sign on as privates, and they dressed accordingly; rare indeed was the officer who took pains to get &#x201c;above himself&#x201d; and stand out from the crowd.<br><br>Typical was Experience Storrs of Mansfield, Connecticut, a prosperous farmer &#x201c;portly in figure&#x201d; who, when not tending his sick wife (&#x201c;troubled with Histeruk Colluk Pains&#x201d;), hewed wood, attended church, cleaned drains, worried about his colds, and mended stone walls&#x2014;�all while serving as his regiment&#x2019;s lieutenant colonel (an almost regal rank far beyond a man of Storrs&#x2019;s socioeconomic background in Europe). In March 1775 he agreed, with his friends Colonel Jedediah Elderkin and Major Thomas Brown, &#x201c;to dress in a plain manner.&#x201d;6 Similarly, at the redoubt Colonel Prescott wore a simple linen coat: British soldiers were later convinced that their foe was commanded by a &#x201c;farmer dressed in his frock.&#x201d;7 Even starchy Colonel John Stark, a man &#x201c;always mindful of his rank,&#x201d; as his biographer had it, was &#x201c;never a stickler for dress,&#x201d; restricting the peacockery to a waistcoat and some kind of &#x201c;insignia.&#x201d;8<br><br>If the militiamen&#x2019;s outfits added up to a drab uniformity, their assortment of weapons was motley, to say the least. One veteran of the battle remembered, &#x201c;Here an old soldier carried a heavy Queen&#x2019;s arm, with which he had done service at the conquest of Canada twenty years previous, while by his side walked a stripling boy, with a Spanish fuzee not half its weight or calibre, which his grandfather may have taken at the Havana [1762], while not a few had old French pieces, that dated back to the reduction of Louisburg [1758].&#x201d;9 Ezekiel Worthen of Kensington, New Hampshire, shouldered a French musket, made in 1752, that had been taken from the enemy, taken again by Indians, and retaken by Worthen during a skirmish. He also brought along a newer accessory: a cartridge box engraved with &#x201c;Liberty or Death.&#x201d;10 (Some weapons were newer acquisitions: Nathaniel Rice of East Sudbury proudly carried &#x201c;a musket I took from the British at Concord.&#x201d;)11<br><br>The antiquity of most of the militiamen&#x2019;s pieces should not obscure their lethality. These were working, effective firearms. In an era when guns were expensive and manufacturing them was a painstaking business, it was common for even regular soldiers to use hand-�me-�downs. The British, for instance, were using Brown Bess muskets&#x2014;�still perfectly serviceable&#x2014;purchased as far back as 1730.12 By that standard, the Americans&#x2019; arms, most of which dated from the French and Indian War, were relatively new and almost certainly better maintained.<br><br>Virtually every man at Bunker Hill brought his own firearm. Ascertaining exact figures for gun ownership in 1775 is extremely difficult. However, an analysis of the returns of thirty New England militia companies finds that the overall rate of private ownership was at least 75 percent and probably much higher. A keen company commander, such as Timothy Pickering of Salem, Massachusetts, ensured that 100 percent of his men were armed. Likewise, at the end of May 1775 all of the 509 men in Colonel Moses Little&#x2019;s Ipswich, Massachusetts, regiment were, boasted a Provincial Congress report, &#x201c;armed with good effective firelocks.&#x201d; Meanwhile, &#x201c;only&#x201d; two-�thirds of the fishermen from maritime Cape Cod owned their own weapon, no doubt because there was less call for them in their line of work.13 Ultimately, those who fought at Bunker Hill would either bring their own musket, use ones illicitly stockpiled by their local militias, or, in a pinch, borrow them from stay-�at-�home neighbors.14<br><br>Like Colonel Abijah Pierce, who touted a fearsome walking cane at Lexington, the militias also lugged along a formidable, if ragged, collection of hand and edged weapons.15 Many were repurposed from agricultural uses: At least one man was seen bearing a grain flail, numerous others with pitchforks, and a few with shillelaghs (wooden cudgels or clubs).16<br><br>Some armed themselves more traditionally. Cutlasses&#x2014;�short, machete-�like hacking swords&#x2014;�could be wielded handily by beginners. Before he left for Boston, Israel Litchfield took the precaution of buying one, despite his complete lack of training.17 During the battle his compatriot Israel Potter thought himself fortunate to be armed so: &#x201c;Although without an edge and much rust-�eaten, I found [the cutlass] of infinite more service to me than my musket&#x201d; when a British officer swiped at his head with a sword. &#x201c;With one well-�directed stroke I deprived him of the power of very soon again measuring swords with &#x2018;a Yankee rebel.&#x2019; &#x201d;18<br><br>Nearly every American sword &#x201c;had been made by our Province blacksmiths, perhaps from some farming utensil; they looked serviceable, but heavy and uncouth,&#x201d; remembered one veteran.19 The country metalworkers had tried their best, but in style these weapons looked decidedly dated, as if they had been excavated from some century-�old time capsule buried during the English Civil War (1642&#x2013;�1651). Aside from the cutlasses, American swords tended to be simple-�hilted straight rapiers for thrusting.20 For their part, recent immigrants fighting alongside the colonials tended to wield weapons from the Old Country: On the night before Bunker Hill the militant cleric John Martin girded himself with his trusty &#x201c;Irish long sword,&#x201d; with which he soon slew one unfortunate Briton &#x201c;by letting out his bowels&#x201d; and another &#x201c;by a stroke on the neck.&#x201d;21<br><br>What the Americans lacked and the British enjoyed in abundance were bayonets, but this would not prove a critical omission. While Captain Henry Dearborn alleged that among all the Americans there were only fifty bayonets available&#x2014;�and in his company just one&#x2014;�bayonets were in fact rarely used in combat, their effect being primarily psychological rather than practical.22 The bayonet, it was thought, made soldiers feel more aggressive when assaulting an already nervous enemy, who was liable to panic and run before a well-�officered attack actually connected. But if the two sides came to blows at close quarters, a grain flail, cutlass, or pitchfork was almost certainly as dangerous as a bayonet, and probably more so. At Bunker Hill, it was only near the end, by which time the redoubt&#x2019;s defenders had been severely weakened by casualties and were out of ammunition, that bayonets&#x2014;�wielded by reinvigorated and reinforced British troops surging forward&#x2014;�helped to provoke flight.</p><h2>Aztec &amp; Maya: The Complete Illustrated History</h2><p>Previously published in two separate volumes, The Lost History of Aztec &amp; Maya and Aztec &amp; Maya: Life in an Ancient Civilization.</p><p></p><h2>Great Ideas Nature (Penguin Great Ideas)</h2><p>Originally published anonymously, Nature was the first modern essay to recommend the appreciation of the outdoors as an all-encompassing positive force.

Many see them as irrelevant, even unattainable, today. But what if we're not that different from those who gathered around Moses as he handed down God's Ten Words to his people? What if they were never meant to be a set of rules, but instead a promise of a covenant relationship? In <em>Ten,</em> Sean Gladding invites you into the story of John, a pastor who spends his mornings in a local coffee shop, as he engages the viewpoints of regular people who wonder at the relevance and meaning of those Ten Words today. Sit in on their lively, heart-felt conversations as they tackle each Word over a cup of coffee and realize the hope of God's promises to his chosen people&#x2015;yesterday, today and forever.</p><p>Sean Gladding is from Norwich, England, but has spent most of his adult life in the United States. He is a storyteller, and his passion in writing is to (re)introduce people to the beautiful, challenging, messy and often confusing Story to be found in the Bible, as well as to address some of the harmful ways that Story has been told. He and his family make their home in Lexington, Kentucky, where they grow food with others, raise chickens, kick a soccer ball around when it&#39;s dry, and play board games when it&#39;s wet."I have read Ten with great interest. Two things in particular struck me. First the way Sean shows how the 'rules' are in the service of a relationship. And second, the way Sean weaves the commandments into real life situations with real people. The latter is a special pastoral gift." Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary<br><br>"Gladding brilliantly exposes how fragile we are in the face of cultural, political, psychological and spiritual forces that militate against our freedom and set us back on our journey toward becoming fully human. This creative and timely work upends the myth that the Ten Commandments are onerously restrictive, and reveals what God intended the Law to be--a pathway to the joy that is our birthright." (Ian Morgan Cron, author of Chasing Francis)<br><br>"Sean Gladding reveals to us a grand biblical narrative refracted through ordinary people's stories. Like light reflected in broken shards of glass, the purity of God's vision for a peaceful, generous, restful, faithful world is described through the struggles and anxieties of everyday folk. You've never heard the Ten Commandments taught quite like this." (Michael Frost, author, The Shaping of Things to Come and Exiles)<br><br>"Integrity is a lost art form--or better still, it is a lost life guide. Maybe biblical integrity is as much about loving our culture, world and neighbor as it is about personal holiness. Sean Gladding has taken his love for God and love of the other and invited each of us into a deeper spiritual devotion through the pages of <em>Ten.</em>" (Tony Kriz, author of Welcome to the Table and Neighbors and Wise Men)<br><br>"<em>Ten</em> is a book for people interested in finding a better way to live. I love the Ten Words and this fresh look at the ancient biblical text of the Ten Commandments. But mostly, I love Sean's perspective. It reminds me of something I tend to forget: Whether we worship in a meeting room with a <em>Big Book</em> or in a congregation that studies the Bible, we humans are more alike than we are different. We are at our best when we are encouraging one another to live well. I give it a ten." (Teresa McBean, executive director, National Association for Christian Recovery)<br><br>"Sean Gladding has done it again. In this immensely readable book, the goodness of God and the relevance of Scripture shine through. Sean draws us into a community of honest conversation by masterfully weaving together believable characters, biblical stories, theology and cultural reflection. As the story of Pastor John's Monday-morning coffee-shop group unfolds, the reader is helped to see that the Ten Commandments are an invitation to live in true freedom. I hope this book will be read and discussed widely, both inside and outside the church."

For the first time ever, resulting from closed-door interviews between the author and Mossad agents, informants, and spymasters, as well as classified documents and top-secret sources, the truth about the Mossad is about to be revealed. From the Mossad agent in the Clinton White House who enabled Israel to call the shots in the ongoing Middle East peace process to the nuclear secrets smuggled out of the U.S. and used to jump-start Israel's own atomic weapons program, <i>Gideon's Spies</i> reveals the Mossad as it truly is: brilliant, ruthless, flawed, but ultimately awesome.<br></p><p>The Mossad was formed in 1951 to coordinate the intelligence-gathering efforts of the still-young nation of Israel. In the nearly half century since, it has become a force to be reckoned with, boasting an impressive track record of counterterrorist actions and assassinations. <i>Gideon's Spies</i> is loaded with anecdotes of their greatest exploits (and a few colossal blunders). Among the most interesting sections are the suggestions that Mossad agents killed media tycoon Robert Maxwell in 1991, that the agency's attempted recruitment of Henri Paul, the driver of Princess Diana's car that fateful night, may have caused sufficient emotional distress to be a contributing factor in the accident, and that Mossad operatives in America had tapes of the phone-sex conversations between President Bill Clinton and his lover Monica Lewinsky. There's also some extensive material on the links between the Israelis and the Vatican, including the Mossad's role in the investigation into the attempted 1981 assassination of Pope John Paul II and the agency's constant battles against the PLO.

He and his friend Martin de Vos had never seen anything like it. <br>"The land swoops right up into the air," said Bruegel. He was a tall young man with a high brow, a big nose, and alert clear gray eyes. "Just like it's supposed to." <br>"Like a great ocean wave," said de Vos. He leaned on his long staff, peering out from under the low brim of his hat. He had a snub nose and a cheerful smile. "It was worth coming all this way from Antwerp." <br>Do you notice how the mountain's flank tilts up towards us?" continued Bruegel. "It's like we're looking down at it from the sky. With everything spread out next to each other. All there for us to see." He stepped off the stony road into the green grass and held out his arms as if to embrace the landscape before him. <br>It was a rain-kissed afternoon in May. Puffy little clouds were scattered across the watery blue sky, some hanging so close to the ground that Bruegel could almost touch them. A small river ran beside the road, lit just now by a patch of sun. Slanting gray streaks of rain caressed the green mountain. Bruegel felt as if his heart were blooming. <br>"I have to draw this," he told de Vos. He shrugged the strap of his satchel from his shoulder, peeled off his skirted jerkin, and sat down cross-legged upon it. He found ink and pen and a bottle of water in his satchel, and pulled a sheet of paper out of a special flap in his jerkin's lining. All the while he was staring at the mountain. "It's quite unlike what we've seen in paintings back in the Low Lands, Martin. Different than what we've been taught. It's less contorted, more like a living thing. It's saying hello to me." <br>De Vos smiled and sat down to watch his friend begin making tiny brown ink marks on his paper. Rather than drawing a scene with long continuous outlines, Bruegel preferred to nibble away at the edges of things with an accumulation of dots and strokes. The progress was steady and surprisingly rapid. <br>Some other travelers passed by, distracting de Vos. This was a busy road, with any number of merchants moving their goods back and forth between Italy and Northern Europe. Beyond the little mountain before them was one of the few passes where a wagon could get through the Alps. <br>"I'll meet you at that monastery by the mountain's base," said de Vos, looking off down the road. "See it? I'll warrant we can find food and lodging there." <br>"Be sure and tell them that we're guild artists," said Bruegel. "Maybe we can make something for them instead of paying cash." <br>"They might want to own the drawing that you're doing right now," suggested de Vos. "It's off to a nice start, I'd say." <br>"The monks won't want a plain nature sketch," said Bruegel. "If I were to offer them this drawing, I'd need to add something Scriptural." <br>"Joseph and Mary on the way to Egypt," suggested de Vos. "The hermit St. Anthony. The repentant Mary Magdalene taking a piss." <br>"I'd like that," said Bruegel, smiling. He was known among his friends for his fondness of sketching people in their private moments. "But the monks are surely beyond such low concerns. I imagine they're educated men. Humanists, perhaps. I could add some Classical figures for them. Mercury and Psyche in the sky. Or Daedalus and Icarus." <br>"Well, in any case be sure to draw their monastery!" said de Vos. "But leave the figures for when you've found your patron." <br>"Good idea, Martin," said Bruegel. "Meanwhile, less of you and more of my pen and this mountain. They're talking to me." <br>"All I hear is the bells of the monks' cows," said de Vos, rising to his feet. "Fat cattle mean good cheese. Bread and cheese and ale and some dark-green mouse-ear lettuce. It's the season for radishes too! There's quite a few buildings over there beyond the monastery. It looks like a regular village. Maybe I'll find a young widow with a hungry eye." De Vos had little more experience with women than Bruegel, but he liked to talk big. <br>He stepped down to the river and splashed some water on his face. He scrambled back to the road, gave Bruegel a cheery wave, and walked off whistling. Bruegel continued to draw, sinking into a kind of conversation with the mountain. <br>Whenever Bruegel concentrated on objects they seemed to talk to him. The quill pen told him how stiff it was and how it loved to be dipped in ink. Its squeaks were as the faint honks of a goose. The sepia ink spoke of the squid and cuttlefish sacks it came from, of water and writhing tentacles. The paper stretched itself out like a dog in the sun; it sighed with satisfaction at being scratched. <br>Most of all, though, it was the mountain that spoke to Bruegel. <br>"I'm alive too," the great mound said. "I move slower than you, but yes, I roll and turn within my sweet green skin. See the cleft at my top? Like the tip of your prick. I leak a stream from there and it's of a marvelous purity, refined by my mineral body. Be sure to sketch in the rim of my stream's gully, Peter. I used to be much taller than the younger mountains beyond me, so make me the highest thing in your picture. I'm old and wise, but on this summer day I feel young. The trees on my flanks are feathered with leaves that shelter all manner of birds, beasts, and men. I'm glad that you're drawing me. Yes, I have a dent halfway up, so shade it dark like that, good, and right before the ridge I'm a bit flat, so the bumps you make for trees should be closer together there. Fine. Leave the paper blank where the sun's very bright upon me, that's perfect. And now fill in that tangle of trees that march up my gorge--I'm lovely in there, Peter, you should walk up onto me and see." <br>After an hour of this, the pleasant mountain had been well depicted. Now Bruegel drew the monastery as well. It had a tidy Gothic chapel, a stone refectory, and a long two-storied wooden residence house with a red tile roof. Just like the mountain, the building spoke to Bruegel as he sketched it, talking about right angles and perspective, about monkishness, and about the joy of having windows. And then the sketch was done. <br>Bruegel sighed and stretched, got to his feet, and looked down at his new drawing, its corners weighted down by little stones. The sun was low in the sky behind him, glazing the world with shades of gold. How lucky he was to be an artist, a guild member in good standing. If all went well--and surely it would!--he'd come into his own before much longer. He'd have his own studio, a string of wealthy patrons, apprentices to make up his paints, and a fine house in the center of Brussels. All this assuming--and here lay Bruegel's great worry--assuming there was a market for the things he saw, and for his way of seeing them. <br>Seeing, seeing, seeing--very nearly the sum of what he did. So often he was the onlooker, off to the side of the street fairs and artists' gatherings in Antwerp, alone with his eyes and the pictures in his head. Peter the Watcher--more than one woman had called him that, and not as a compliment. Someday he'd have his studio, and his patrons, and his house; he'd have a wife and a family and he'd be a watcher no more. <br>Even as he reviewed these overfamiliar thoughts, Bruegel was examining his drawing, feeling each bit with his eyes, looking for any weakness or excess. Now and then he stooped to make a hook or a dash with the nib of his pen. Soon he was done. The picture was outside him now, born into the world, leaving a hole he could only fill with the next picture to come. <br>He put away his ink, pen, and paper and walked down the road, observing, as always, the way that a landscape sprang into a new kind of life when he moved through it. Bruegel savored the suave way in which the world's perspectives rotated: the nearby trees turned as if on spindles; the fields and orchards constellated themselves into new alignments; and the most distant landmarks seemed to sail along with him, keeping pace with his passage. The world danced a stately jig about you, if only you watched. <br>The little road arced away from a bog by the river and passed through a wet field crisscrossed with streams. The peach-colored clouds were reflected in the scattered patches of green water--exquisite. The road swung back to a ford in the river beside a couple of farmhouses. Behind Bruegel were Nice, Provence, and the setting sun, ahead of him lay the Alps, the Po Valley, Lombardy, Parma, Florence, and Rome. Some cattle stood in the river drinking water, with a peasant boy watching over them. <br>Bruegel had his own memories of tending cattle for Graaf de Hoorne, the nobleman who owned the estates where he'd been raised. Long, peaceful days those had been, off on his own with some bread and cheese, keeping the cows from the crops, leading them to good pastures, herding them home at night, with no company save a dog or, on the best days, the merry Anja. Sometimes, to make Anja laugh, he'd drawn faces with a muddy stick upon a cow's great, round side. Naughty Anja, more and less than a sister--where was she now? He'd never seen her once since they'd sent him away from the village. Out to seek his fortune. And here he was at the Alps, seeking ever farther afield. <br>Bruegel tipped his hat to the boy and picked his way across the water. A line of cypresses grew along the uphill road to the monastery. The trees' tops blended into one long worm, and the bare trunks twisted down like legs. Viewed as one great chimerical being, the line of trees was a caterpillar. Bruegel walked up the slope; he was happy to be finally starting up the slope of an Alp. According to de Vos, this was the route that Hannibal took up through the Alps in ancient times. Bruegel tried to visualize the Moorish troops and their elephants. <br>There had been an elephant in Antwerp last year, the property of a financier. But Bruegel had been off working as an artist's assistant in Mechelen right then, and before he could get back to Antwerp to perhaps sketch the elephant, the hot-blooded beast had died of the damp winter...</p><h2>A Dishonorable Few (Volume 4) (Honor Series, 4)</h2><p>Robert Macomber's Honor series of naval fiction follows the life and career of Peter Wake in the U.S. Navy during the tumultuous years from 1863 to 1901.

Fearing that the intrigues of Hancock and the Sons of Liberty might set the colonies ablaze, Duncan relentlessly pursues the truth, only to be falsely charged with treason and murder. With the help of Ethan Allen, aged natives, and outlawed Jesuits, he survives scalp hunters, imprisonment, and his own spiritual crisis, only to realize he cannot resolve the terrible crimes until he first understands the emerging truths about freedom in the American colonies.</p><p><b>ELIOT PATTISON</b> is the author of <i>The Skull Mantra</i>, winner of an Edgar Award and finalist for the Gold Dagger, as well as <i>Water Touching Stone, Bone Mountain, Beautiful Ghosts, Prayer of the Dragon, Bone Rattler, The Lord of Death, Eye of the Raven, Original Death</i>, and, most recently, <i>Blood of the Oak</i>.

When McCallum's close friend Adam Munroe and a professor who was to work as a tutor are added to the list of the dead, McCallum, who has extensive medical training, is enlisted by the captain to investigate. The shipboard mysteries remain unresolved when they arrive in New York, and McCallum's quest for the truth leads him to perilous encounters on both sides of the French and Indian War.

A thoroughly gripping read." &#x2015;Margaret Barr, <i>Historical Novel Society</i> <br><br> "Pattison, acclaimed for previous novels such as the excellent <i>The Skull Mantra</i> and <i>Bone Rattler</i>, reveals the complex negotiations between the well-known British and French governments but also the Iroquois tribes regarding the land and resources in the Pennsylvania region. He wisely chooses not to create caricatures of any nationality, but instead shows the difficulties the wise leaders of each group have in maneuvering through the greed and baser instincts found everywhere." &#x2015;Bonnye Busbice Good, <i>New Mystery Reader</i><br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Original Death</i></b><br><br> "If this were a movie, we'd marvel at the set decoration that splendidly evokes the period. The excellent prose narrative goes right to the matter in question, the state of the (pre-Colonial) human heart." &#x2015;<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br> "<i>Original Death</i> sweeps the reader along on a compelling and suspenseful hero's journey in which the realms of the spirit world of the Iroquois mingle with the harsh world of the colonial era frontier and the military ambitions of the French and English colonial powers. Pattison's riveting storytelling and intriguing plot kept me entranced from the first page. His understanding of the complexities of the era and the frontier make his portrayal of Duncan's and Conawago's quest a multi-layered and complex read, one to savor. It fascinates and comes very highly recommended." &#x2015;<i>Historical Novel Society</i><br><br> "Edgar-winner Pattison combines action, period details, and a whodunit with ease in his impressive third mystery set in Colonial America. The French and Indian War is in its sixth year in 1760, and the American wilderness is full of armed men lusting to soak the land in blood for the sake of distant kings... The quest gets off to an ominous start with McCallum's discovery of a dead soldier tied to a wheel at the bottom of a lake. As the bodies pile up, Pattison pays tribute to the conventions of the murder mystery without sacrificing excitement or a nuanced look at the final stage of the war between the British and the French for control of North America." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br><br> "Pattison twists a skein of plotlines and weaves Indian mysticism into a time-capsule portrait of America at a crossroads: a time of endings for some and the beginning of a revolution played out by cruel, compelling, and sometimes powerful people with warring visions. Themes of disillusionment and a vanishing way of life make this series in some ways similar to Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, though Pattison adds an element of psychological suspense comparable to Jean Zimmerman's <i>The Orphanmaster</i> (2012) and a degree of human complexity that suggests Sarah Donati's <i>Wilderness</i> novels." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br><br> "This is the kind of historical fiction that makes for breathtaking reading. Pattison has done an admirable job of researching a little known incident in the history of the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania where the Moravians had several missions and transferred that story to upstate New York. In doing so he turned that historical incident into both a thrilling entertainment and a modern day look at the intolerance and brutality of the military. One cannot help but draw parallels to the violence of US military perpetrated against Islamic civilians whether aggressive and intentional or accidental victims of 'friendly fire' in Afghanistan and Iraq." &#x2015;<i>Pretty Sinister Books</i><br><br> "As strong as the plot is, it is the elegantly crafted prose, almost lyrical in the way it weaves the story, that will draw readers in. Original Death is exciting and suspenseful, often mystical and frequently cruel and violent, but always true to the characters. One of the best books of the year." &#x2015;<i>Mysterious Reviews</i> <br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Blood of the Oak</i></b><br><br> "In 1765, the French and Indian War is over, but the American colonies are not at peace, as shown in Edgar-winner Pattison's superior fourth mystery featuring Scottish ex-pat Duncan McCallum (after 2013's <i>Original Death</i>)...

The car, a petite AC sports car with a Ford V-8 engine stuffed under its hood, should have been an instant anachronism. Instead, the Cobra soon proved to be the hottest thing on four wheels, dominating racetracks from Laguna Seca to Le Mans. <i>The Complete Book of Shelby Automobiles: Cobras, Mustangs, and Super Snakes</i> details all of Shelby&#x2019;s automotive creations, from the first Cobras and Mustang GT350s of the 1960s through the one-off race cars to the very latest Mustangs Shelby produces today.</p><p>Shelby American gained almost instant recognition from the moment the first Cobra hit the street.&nbsp;The entire original Cobra/Ford GT/Shelby Mustang period spanned just over eight years, eight years filled with countless racing accomplishments, the World Manufacturer&#x2019;s Championship, a 1-2-3 finish at LeMans, you name it and Shelby won it. The underdog did it, and to this day we are still rooting for him. And deservedly so.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The stories and accomplishments are legendary, but none more so than what can only be described as the magic this company and its cars possess to this day. It was the perfect storm. Shelby found the right ingredients, the right talent, the right sponsors, the right drivers, and enough unbridled enthusiasm to take what some had called &#x201c;a bunch of junk&#x201d; out into the world and not come home until there wasn&#x2019;t a challenge they didn&#x2019;t win. Call it what you will - dumb luck, stubbornness, or just being in the right place at the right time, nobody can deny that we will never see the likes of anything like Shelby ever again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Complete Book of Shelby is just that -&nbsp;a complete listing of Shelby automobiles. It is the story of every car ever touched by that Shelby magic. From Cobras to Mustangs, race cars to street cars, AC Cars to Toyota, it is your ticket to knowing a little more about every vehicle that Shelby "messed with" as the big Texan would say.&nbsp;Like anybody else, and any other manufacturer, Shelby had its ups and downs. There were great cars and cars we&#x2019;d rather forget. But the story is indeed one of legend, and&nbsp;larger than life. The tale and the cars transcend traditional boundaries. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you are a Chevy person&nbsp;or a European car enthusiast, a drag racer or a&nbsp;road racer, into NASCAR or sports cars, or even if you're&nbsp;not even really a "car person" there is something about Shelby that appeals to us all. It is an American success story. And not one of us can ever deny we always respect the underdog who beat all the odds to come out on top. That, in a nutshell, is the story of Shelby American. And every one of the cars that follows has that DNA in it.

Readers of Agatha Christie are a natural audience for this study in peculiarity." - <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"We all know Truss can work miracles--after all, she managed to make a manual on punctuation (<i>Eats, Shoots and Leaves)</i> a bestseller--but I doubt even Constable Twitten could work out how she has produced a whodunit that exudes heartwarming cosiness whilst boasting <i>Game of Thrones</i>levels of violent death, or given her cast of amusing caricatures more life than most of the characters I&#x2019;ve encountered in fiction this year." - <i>Daily Telegraph</i></p><p>"Truss piles up ingenious plot twists, preposterous coincidences, snarky asides, and characters out of P.G. Wodehouse, this time replacing her murderous felines with a setup out of the genre's golden age." - <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"It takes a writer of Lynne Truss's wit and intelligence . . . to take on both the cosy and comic fields, shaking them up to forge something fresh and beguiling . . . A large cast of strongly drawn characters (including an "angry young man" dramatist) helps to keep things bubbling along, and not only is the whole thing delightfully witty-- more early Evelyn Waugh than Agatha Christie--it also functions very successfully as a novel in the vein of the genre it is satirising: the police procedural . . . As in <i>Brighton Rock, </i>we are given a vivid picture of Brighton in its pre-chic heyday, with the kiss-me-quick hats and candy-floss era providing bags of colour . . . Twitten, in particular, is a delightful creation." - <i>Barry Forshaw, Independent</i></p><p>"Truss's new crime novel is an unqualified masterpiece." - <i>Glasgow Herald</i></p><p>"<b>Bringing the undoubted comic talents of Lynne Truss to crime fiction should be a marriage made in heaven, and that is exactly what it turns out to be. <i>A Shot in the Dark</i> is sheer, witty delight</b>. Crime fiction used to be associated with high spirits, but they have become estranged over the years. Lynne Truss has put the two elements back in touch, with <b>enchanting</b> results." - <i>Simon Brett, Author of DEATH ON THE DOWNS</i></p><p>"This farcical tale is packed with interwoven plotlines, clues strewn about like confetti and a comically oblivious chief inspector. It reads like a stage comedy . . . Sharp and witty, <i>A Shot in the Dark</i> is a good time." - <i>Top Pick in Cozies, BookPage</i></p><p>"I thought anyone who could make a grammar book amusing and engaging must be able to write a good novel. <i>A Shot in the Dark</i>&#x2015;a comedic, dark mystery&#x2015;more than meets my expectations. . . . as much a dance as a mystery. . . . a must-read for anyone who loves mysteries and has an adventurous spirit." - <i>Killer Nashville</i></p><p>"The highly entertaining game is most seriously afoot in <i>A Shot in the Dark</i> by Lynne Truss . . . Murder, both cold- and hot-blooded, gangsters, and a suspiciously high number of comforting cups of tea and accompanying cakes make for a quasi-cosy and very funny read." - <i>Seattle Review of Books</i></p><p>"This sparkling murder mystery set in 1957 Brighton is murder-novel debut by Lynne Truss, the grammar maven famous for <i>Eats, Shoots and Leaves</i>, and it's entirely winning from the first page, a finely-balanced combination of clashing personalities and cutting humor." - <i>Open Letters Monthly, &#x201c;Best Books of 2018: Mystery!&#x201d;</i></p></p><h2>Be Right : How to be Right with God, Yourself, and Others (An Expository Study of Romans)</h2><p>Over 3 Million "Be" Books in Print!

Exploring these early years of aviation, Joseph Corn describes the fascinating, and often bizarre, plans for the future of manned flight (including the Depression-era dream of "an airplane in every garage") and brings back to life the famous and lesser-known aviators who became American heroes&#x2013;Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, Calbraith P.

He lives in Sussex and London.Jeremy Hutchinson was born in London in 1915. He read PPE at Magdalen College, Oxford, before studying law. His breakthrough case came in 1960 when Penguin Books was prosecuted under the recently enacted Obscene Publications Act 1959 for publishing Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover. Jeremy&#39;s skill as a cross-examiner soon became legendary; it is said that he provided a partial inspiration for John Mortimer&#39;s Rumpole of the Bailey. He retired from the bar in 1984.

He was a most formidable advocate of the 1960s and &#39;70s and he had a marvellous sense of mischief -- Geoffrey Robertson Hutchinson provides the memories and Grant puts pen to paper. The result is a multifaceted object: a celebration of a brilliant career, an explanation of the legal process and a social and cultural history of the second half of the 20th century ... Jeremy Hutchinson&#39;s Case Histories is, above all, a romance Daily Telegraph A fine reminder of the great democratic values enshrined in our legal system ... Grant has cleverly produced what amounts to a cultural history of Britain in the rapidly changing post-war years ... a greatly entertaining read which celebrates a barrister who stood up and argued with clarity and passion for various freedoms that we now take for granted Daily Express A fascinating look at Britain&#39;s post-war social, political and cultural history Bookseller [Jeremy Hutchinson] is my hero because of what he stands for today, as he continues to speak out against what he fears to be the loss of independent representation of those not merely down on their luck but down in the gutter. He is the living symbol of all that independent criminal advocacy means for justice and the rule of law Guardian Jeremy Hutchinson&#39;s Case Histories ... makes a compelling read, and is a real contribution to the history of twentieth-century English mentalities. It is also a first-rate lesson in simple humanity ... The pungency, intelligence and humour of [Thomas] Grant and his subject make this the most enlivening of case-books ... [Jeremy Hutchinson] is abundant in the qualities of empathy, consideration and humour. He manages to be both charming and shatteringly truthful Guardian A fascinating episodic cultural history of postwar Britiain, that chronicles the end of the age of deference and secrecy, and the advent of a more permissive society ... an impassioned defence of the criminal Bar itself ... Grant brings out the essence of each case, and Hutchinson&#39;s role, with clarity and wit ... a reminder of how many of the defining stories of modern times have been fought out through our courts, and changed by them The Times Given my automatic animus, you can imagine how confusing it was to be charmed into surrender by Thomas Grant&#39;s traversal of Hutchinson&#39;s long career as a QC Observer Jeremy Hutchinson&#39;s Case Histories reminds us of the celebrated, and infamous, cases in which Hutchinson appeared, the skills he deployed, and the importance of the criminal defence advocate to the rule of law. Reheated recollections of old cases rarely make for a tasty dish. But the ingredients of Hutchinson&#39;s casebook are exceptionally delicious, and Grant&#39;s recipe and presentation are irresistible ... One of the merits of this entertaining collection of Jeremy Hutchinson&#39;s greatest hits is that the authentic sound of the great advocate can be heard again, loud and clear ... Thomas Grant ensures that we understand Lord Hutchinson&#39;s achievements and the importance of the principles of criminal defence advocacy to a free society -- David Pannick QC The Times Author and QC Thomas Grant does a fine job ... Hutchinson&#39;s priceless advocacy is every bit as powerful on the page and Grant brilliantly recaptures the tensions and drama of some of the most seminal Old Bailey criminal trials of the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties ... It is hard to imagine a more interesting time for a criminal advocate to be working and this wonderful book is a celebration not just of the man but of the profession itself Evening Standard All these cases make thoroughly good reading, while vividly illuminating the morals and mores of that now distant period just a generation ago. But the sting in the tail of the book comes in the postscript by the centenarian Hutchinson himself ... a powerful indictment of the wanton destruction by ignorant politicians of the whole edifice of British justice as he knew it Financial Times An attractive picture of a life honourably and enjoyably lived. Naturally, it supports the argument that we are a more civilised society today because of the battles which people like Hutchinson fought and won ... So a happy century to Jeremy Hutchinson, who represented decency even when he defended indecency -- Charles Moore Sunday Telegraph His life reads like a history of the 20th century ... A resounding postscript written by Jeremy Hutchinson himself shows that at the age of 100, he has lost none of his extraordinary power and authority Daily Mail Fascinating Daily Mail One of the most enjoyable books this summer is Jeremy Hutchinson&#39;s Case Histories, a biography by Thomas Grant of an extraordinary man The Times So began a career that would see Hutchinson, son of a renowned barrister, member of the artistic Bloomsbury set, prosecute and defend in some of the biggest criminal cases of the era, reshaping censorship and secrecy along the way, his life an extraordinary window into the 20th century Brighton Argus An excellent book charting some of Jeremy&#39;s more remarkable trials and his very eclectic clients, many of whom he cared for deeply Daily Mail Biographies of lawyers are very rare, but Hutchinson&#39;s career was so unusually varied that it makes a splendid subject for a book ...

If one personal quality shines through this discreet and admiring book, it is Hutchinson&#39;s humanity and understanding of human frailty TLS At first glance, you might wonder how interesting a book about a lawyer can be. But once you open the pages of this one, you&#39;ll be instantly hooked ... Totally terrific Daily Mail A brilliant and absorbing book about the life of a barrister. And what a life Evening Standard Thomas Grant has brought together Hutchinson&#39;s greatest legal hits, and in the process has produced a fascinating episodic cultural history of postwar Britain, chronicling the end of the age of deference and the advent of a more permissive society.

It was a sunny but chilly March day, with a cold wind blowing from the north. </p><p> Outside, the traffic at the dread five corners in Vineyard Haven was moving smoothly along. Such would not be the case when summer arrived and the street would be a slow-moving parking lot. </p><p> "Too bad the twins couldn't make it down with you," said Zee, wiping her lips. </p><p> "The girls have more interesting ways to spend their long weekend than being with their parents," said Mattie. "They're college women now." </p><p> I could remember when John and Mattie's daughters, Jen and Jill, were little girls, about the ages our children were now. I hadn't been able to tell them apart then, and I still couldn't. "They don't make a quesadilla as good as this one up in Weststock," I said. </p><p> "But Weststock has college men," explained Mattie. "Compared to that, even E and E food has insufficient appeal." </p><p> "You're brave to leave them alone up there for three days," said Zee. </p><p> I suspected that she was thinking of our Diana, who would be of interest to young men in another ten years or so. I shared her view, having begun worrying about just such boys shortly after Diana had been born. </p><p> "They're eighteen," said John, who made his living teaching medieval lit at Weststock College. "They're supposed to be grown-up enough to stay out of trouble." </p><p> I had never grown up that much, so said nothing about John's fantasy. </p><p> The front door opened and let in both some cold air and John Reilley, who looked carefully around the room, nodded slightly to me, and went to the counter to order. </p><p> I knew a folk song about a sailor named John Riley, but I didn't know much about this John Reilley. Two things I did know were that he always took a survey of a room before he entered it, and that he was a carpenter with the reputation of being good with his hands. It was an excellent reputation to have on an island that was awash with money being spent by people buying old houses, tearing them down, and then building massive new ones. John Reilley would never be out of work as long as he lived on Martha's Vineyard. </p><p> Almost immediately the door opened again and three other men came in, one limping slightly and carrying a silver-headed cane. After sweeping the room with their eyes, they followed John Reilley to the counter. Apparently today was a day when everybody was checking out delis before they came in. Strange. </p><p> "Well, well," said John Skye in a quiet voice. "I see that even evil real estate developers are allowed in this joint." </p><p> My face apparently revealed my ignorance, because John added, "The one in the middle is Donald Fox, the boss of Saberfox. The one on his right is his little brother Paul. I don't know the guy with the cane." </p><p> "Ah," said Zee, straightening and frowning as she looked at Donald Fox. "The Savannah Swordsman himself, eh?" </p><p> I now glanced that way, too, for Fox's name was a headliner in the local press. The Fox brothers were tall, handsome men wearing expensive winter coats, but Donald's face was as hard as his brother's was gentle. </p><p> "The very same," said John. "Did I tell you that one of his minions has contacted us and made the now famous offer to purchase our place?" </p><p> "No, you didn't," said Zee, glancing at Mattie's angry face, "but Jeff and I have also been honored by a similar visit. The rep was a Mr. Albert Kirkland, complete with coat and tie and one of those little laptop computers that people carry around instead of briefcases these days. Jeff told him to take a hike." </p><p> "I was much nicer than that," I said. "I just told him we weren't interested in selling any land." </p><p> "And he said that it might be wise to reconsider since a lot of Vineyard land titles are pretty fuzzy and that Saberfox was doing extensive research in the Registry of Deeds." </p><p> "He left before any shots were fired," I said. </p><p> "What's scary," said Zee, "is that Saberfox has more money and lawyers than God and can outspend almost anybody who has land he wants. Donald Fox has already ripped off half the people on the island and he's suing the other half." </p><p> "That's a slight exaggeration," I said. "He's mostly ripped off poor people, because the rich ones have as many lawyers as he does." </p><p> "Well, he's after Dodie Donawa's place for sure! He's done what he always does: he's offered her about a quarter of what the place is worth, and told her if she doesn't go along, he'll take her to court! She'll have to take his offer because she hasn't got the money to fight him. Disgusting! If Dave Donawa was still alive he'd probably shoot him!" </p><p> "Maybe somebody else will do it, dear." </p><p> "It wouldn't surprise me!" </p><p> "Down, Fang! I think we should change the subject before you get so mad you hurt yourself." </p><p> Zee glared at me, then at Fox, then back at me. She was not in a conciliatory mood. I turned to John. "What's your next project, now that you're finally done with <i>Gawain?</i>" </p><p> John Skye had been working for years on an ultimate authoritative translation of <i>Gawain and the Green Knight</i> and had at last finished it, whereupon he had immediately entered into a serious state of postpartum blues. This was a typical experience, he said, of writers who had just finished books. And there was only one way out of it: start a new one. </p><p> "Well, that Southern swashbuckler over there gives me one idea," he said. "Maybe I'll write a history of swordplay, from sharp sticks to modern fencing. Who better than me? After all, I dazzled them on the fencing strip when I was an undergraduate, and now that I'm almost a rich and famous literary scholar I'm the right man for the job." </p><p> "He's kidding about the rich and famous part, of course," said Mattie. "So far all he's gotten from Gawain is some good prepub commentary from other medievalists. He doesn't even have a publisher." </p><p> "But I'll get one," said John, waving a professorial hand. "Readers all over the world will be lined up to buy copies. I'll be on endless book tours. It's inevitable." </p><p> "I'm impressed by the way you can keep a straight face when you say that," said Zee. "I don't believe I know any rich and famous scholars." </p><p> "I'll be the first," said John. "Anyway, maybe I'll do the fencing book. Skeptics will claim that it won't make any money either, because there are only about two fencers left in the United States and neither of them can afford to buy a book. They'll say that it's a typical pointy-headed-intellectual project: a book no one will read, about a topic totally irrelevant to modern times. But what do they know?" </p><p> Fencing, it was true, was not a major sport in America. However, it did have its practitioners, including several who worked out twice a week in the high school gym as members of the Martha's Vineyard Fencing Club. I'd watched them a time or two myself, attracted, no doubt, by having seen a number of swashbuckling movies on late-night TV. </p><p> I'd even been persuaded to pick up a foil, but had rapidly realized that I had no more skill as a fencer than as a dancer, and that the cause for both failures was the same: feet that didn't move properly when called upon to do so. They worked well enough for other things, but not for dancing or fencing. The reason was elusive but the fact was certain. </p><p> John, on the other hand, had on his library wall a battered mask centered on a triangled crossing of foil, �p�e, and saber that testified to his collegiate skill as a three-weapon man. Now, at sixty or so, he did his fencing with his forefinger, thrusting and parrying gracefully in thin air as he outlined his project. </p><p> "The first good part, of course, will be the research. I'll find out stuff I never knew. I'll go back into history as far as I can and trace sword fighting up to modern times, when training for combat turned into a sport." </p><p> "I presume you'll have a chapter on Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks Junior," I said, "and another one on Zorro. They're the only fencers most people have ever heard of." </p><p> "A splendid idea. I'll have a chapter devoted to the movies, complete with lots of pictures. Flynn wasn't much of a fencer, by his own admission, but Cornell Wilde was a potential Olympian. </p><p> "Most people probably never heard of the real fencing champions -- Nadi and Fonst and d'Oriola and the others -- but they'll know about them when I win the Nobel Prize and fencing becomes the world's most popular sport. And they'll know about the guys who were around when I was slinging steel: Levis and Axelrod and Richards and Juan Diego Valentine." </p><p> "Are you going to mention our friend Donald Fox?" asked Mattie sourly. "Wasn't he America's only Olympic-gold-medalist fencer before he became a real estate tycoon?" </p><p> The tycoon under discussion, perhaps hearing his name, glanced her way with sharp, pitiless eyes. He stared at our table, then turned away. </p><p> Beyond him John Reilley looked at him thoughtfully, then turned and walked out into the chilly street, carrying his order in a paper bag. </p><p> "Sure," said John Skye, "I'll mention Fox. I'll have to, because like him or not he was the most successful competitive fencer America has ever produced." He paused. "Some people who know fencing think he was the best saber man the world has produced in the last fifty years. Personally, though, I'd put my money on Juan Diego Valentine." </p><p> "Was he a world champion?" asked Zee. </p><p> "No," said John. "But I saw him in Spain when I was over there one summer. He was training for the Spanish Olympic team. He was the best I ever saw. Better than me, even, if you can imagine that." </p><p> "Inconceivable," said Mattie, rolling her eyes. </p><p> "What happened to him?" asked Zee. </p><p> John shrugged. "Who knows? I expected him to win the Olympic gold medal the next year, but he wasn't even on the Spanish team. Maybe he got hurt, or maybe he decided to enter a monastery. Things happen." </p><p> Across the room, Donald Fox and his companions took their paper bags of food and headed out the door. </p><p> John gestured. "Apparently Mr. Fox is so busy making money that he has to eat on the run just like ordinary human beings." </p><p> The rest of us turned to watch the men hunch their shoulders against the wind and walk across the street. They were about halfway across when I heard two little firecracker sounds off to the right and the man John had identified as Paul Fox staggered and fell. The man with the cane instantly muscled Donald Fox at a fast trot across the street to the shelter of a building on the corner. </p><p> I rose without thinking and headed for the door. "Call nine-one-one," I said to the boy behind the counter. "Tell them that a man's been shot." </p><p> "Wait!" cried Zee. </p><p> But I didn't wait. When I got to the street I glanced in the direction of the firecracker sounds, saw nothing, and ran out to the fallen man. I got my arms under him and dragged him back to shelter in front of the deli. He was white-faced and moaning between gritted teeth. </p><p> "Help is coming," I said. "Do you know where you're hit?" </p><p> He put a hand on the center of his chest. "Right here. It hurts. God damn!" He was gasping for breath. </p><p> I tore open his coat and saw two slugs half buried in a bulletproof vest. </p><p> "You're wearing armor." </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "A fortunate choice of clothing. Lie still." </p><p> On the far side of the street the man with the cane had both arms around Donald Fox, holding him back. </p><p> "Stay right where you are till the cops get here," I called to them. "He's going to be okay." Then I looked at the deli door, where John Skye and Mattie were hanging on to Zee, and said, "You stay right there, too!" Mattie and John hung on harder. </p><p> I heard the first of the sirens. "You'll be fine," I said to Paul Fox, "but stay where you are until the medics get here." </p><p> His eyes were wide and full of fear. </p><p> </p><p>Copyright � 2003 by Philip R.

In a world without the time and space for innocence, the narrator intimately recalls her younger self&#x2014;a fierce and discerning girl open to life&#x2019;s pleasures and keen to its ruthless cycle of tragedy.<br><br>With raw language and a brilliant sense of humor, both delicate and unafraid, Nettel strings together hard-won, unwieldy memories&#x2014;taking us from Mexico City to Aix-en-Provence, France, then back home again&#x2014;to create a portrait of the artist as a young girl. In these pages, Nettel&#x2019;s art of storytelling transforms experience into inspiration and a new startling perception of reality.<br><br>"Nettel's eye...gives rise to a tension, subtle but persistent, that immerses us in an uncomfortable reality, disquieting, even disturbing&#x2014;a gaze that illuminates her prose like an alien sun shining down on our world." &#x2014;Valeria Luiselli, author of&nbsp;<i>Sidewalks</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Faces in the Crowd</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"It has been a long time since I've found in the literature of my generation a world as personal and untransferable as that of Guadalupe Nettel." &#x2014;Juan Gabriel V�squez, author of&nbsp;<i>The Sound of Things Falling</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"Nettel reveals the subliminal beauty within beings...and painstakingly examines the intimacies of her soul." &#x2014;<i>Magazine Litt�raire</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Guadalupe Nettel&#x2019;s storytelling power is majestic."&#x2014;<i>Typographical Era</i><br>&nbsp;<br><b>In Praise of&nbsp;<i>Natural Histories</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>"Five flawless stories..." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nettel&#x2019;s stories are as atmospheric and emotionally battering as Checkhov&#x2019;s.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Asymptote</i></p><p>The&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;described&nbsp;GUADALUPE&nbsp;NETTEL&#x2019;s acclaimed English-language debut,&nbsp;<i>Natural Histories</i>, as &#x201c;five flawless stories.&#x201d; A Bogot� 39 author and Granta &#x201c;Best Untranslated Writer,&#x201d; Nettel has received numerous prestigious awards, including the Gilberto Owen National Literature Prize, the Antonin Artaud Prize, the Ribera del Duero Short Fiction Award, and&nbsp;the Anna Seghers Prize. She was short-list for the Neustadt Prize,&nbsp;and most recently, won the 2014 Herralde Novel Prize.&nbsp;<i>The Body Where I Was Born,</i>&nbsp;a<i>&nbsp;</i>novel of an unconventional childhood in the seventies,&nbsp;is her first novel to appear in English. Nick Flynn called it "utterly compelling .... [Nettel]&nbsp;has brilliantly found a form to contain the multitudes of what one body can hold."&nbsp;She lives and works in Mexico City."With straightforward, honest prose, Nettel paints a vivid portrait of a girl always just on the edge of community and illustrates the beauty and strength of a mind shaped by hardship. She perfectly captures the awkwardness and insecurities of growing up and the small, strange moments that change us forever."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly </i>(PW Pick)<br><br>"One of the fascinating qualities of this book is the unsparing testimony, somewhere between religious confession and secular disclosure, that gives a sharp sense of a woman&#x2019;s harrowing girlhood. Nettel&#x2019;s candid, unaffected prose hews closely to the strictures of the therapy session.&nbsp;In this, she runs the risk of turning her story into a &#x201c;case.&#x201d; ...&nbsp;Still, Nettel&#x2019;s strategy yields rich rewards. Concealing the adult narrator disturbs the distance between reader and author; the intimacy �forces the reader into the girl&#x2019;s vulnerable body. This vivid image of the ardent girl as revealed by a faceless woman hints at the tangled snare of the past. An effort to shed an old self may simply make a person disappear.&nbsp;&#x2014;<i><b>The New York Times Book Review</b></i><br><br>"Nettel's eye lightly deforms things and gives rise to a tension, subtle but persistent, that immerses us in an uncomfortable reality, disquieting, even disturbing&#x2014;a gaze that illuminates her prose like an alien sun shining down on our world." &#x2014;<b>Valeria Luiselli</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Sidewalks</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Faces in the Crowd&nbsp;</i><br><br><i>"The Body Where I Was Born</i>&nbsp;infuses the reader with an intimate portrait of the astute and wondrous depth that children use to observe and makes sense of humanity. The language in the book is poetic yet accessible, and at certain points Nettel hits you with a sentence so brilliant and poignant that you have to read it another time in order to fully indulge the narrator&#x2019;s oral recollection of who she was. This book is fierce and from the gut. It is a testimony of a woman finding agency in her body because it is physical evidence that connects her to the planet and the rest of humanity."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>World Literature Today</i><br><br>"Here is an utterly compelling memoir about a specific body, which simultaneous conjures the fragility of that body, as well as the ever-shifting body of memory itself.

From "one of the outstanding humorous writers of the century."--<i>The Modern Age</i>In the words of his biographer, Alan Bishop, Joyce Cary (1888-1957) was &#39;a prolific, independent, wide-ranging writer with a place in three literatures (English, Irish, Nigerian) difficult to categorize because his writing integrates the traditional and experimental.&#39; He was difficult to categorize which probably explains why his reputation is not more secure. However he was undoubtedly a major novelist of the twentieth century, and in acknowledgement of that Faber Finds is reissuing twelve of his works - Mister Johnson, Herself Surprised, To Be a Pilgrim, The Horse&#39;s Mouth, A Prisoner of Grace, Except the Lord, Not Honour More, Castle Corner, Charley is My Darling, A House of Children, The Moonlight and A Fearful Joy. The Horse&#39;s Mouth remains Joyce Cary&#39;s most famous novel but this extensive reissue programme will demonstrate to readers this is only one of many equally successful, challenging but entertaining works in his canon.Although never fashionable, Joyce Cary has always had his admirers:&#39;This novelist has exemplified the rule that when a writer dies, he or she may suffer a lapse in attention. You say to someone &#34;Joyce Cary&#34; and they say &#34;Who?&#34;. Amazing! He was a marvellous writer, fresh, funny and popping with life.&#39; Doris Lessing&#39;A splendid writer&#39; John Updike&#39;Whenever I am idle I choose a Cary novel in the way that I might seek a friend&#39;s company, and it is not long before I am encouraged, inspired to write.&#39; Paul Theroux&#39;To find a novelist who saw more deeply and conveyed more truly you have to go back to Dostoievsky and Tolstoy, Balzac and Goethe, Mann and Hesse ... What makes him a life enhancer is the overwhelming sense the reader gets from him that the universe, for all its horrors and inexplicabilities, makes sense - obvious and glorious sense.&#39; Bernard Levin</p><h2>Mrs. Biddlebox (GOLDEN KITE AWARDS (AWARDS))</h2><p>On a knotty little hill,<br>In a dreary little funk,<br>Mrs. Biddlebox rolled over<br>On the wrong side<br>of her bunk.<br><p></p><p>Mrs. Biddlebox is having a <i>really</i> bad day.

Her family moved to Paris three years later when her father was appointed court astrologer to King Charles V. Close ties to the royal court and her father&#39;s encouragement enabled Christine to obtain a good education, unusual for women of her time. At the age of fifteen, she married a court notary, who also fostered her learning and her literary activities. She was only twenty-five when she was widowed and left without an inheritance. With three children to support, Christine turned to writing to earn her living. From 1390 to 1429, the presumed year of her death, she wrote more than twenty works, nearly all concerned with two themes: the political life of France and the defense of women. The Book of the City of Ladies is Christine de Pizan&#39;s most eloquent expression of her feminist beliefs.<b>Christine de Pizan </b>was an Italian French late medieval author.

An avid reader, traveler, and all-around arts lover, Ms. Hahn lives in Columbia, Maryland, with her two cats, Oscar and Rufus.Grade 4-6-Sixth-grader Gordy Smith flees College Park, MD, with his mother and younger siblings to escape an abusive, alcoholic father, seeking refuge with his affluent maternal grandmother in Grandville, NC. Always an outsider, the boy protects himself from rejection with a veneer of insolence and pugnacity, bragging about his brother Donny who is fighting the Nazis in Germany. He jeopardizes his only friendship when he tries a dangerous experiment to get the boy, a fatherless polio victim, to walk. Donny's return from the war brings further disillusionment when the young man shares his horrible experiences and falls short of Gordy's expectations of a conquering hero. When their father arrives to reclaim his family, Gordy refuses to fall back into the old pattern of violence, choosing instead the uncertain security of remaining with his grandmother. The story is absorbing and, for the most part, believable, and details of the period are accurate. But Gordy's first-person narrative renders characterization incomplete, and readers are left with some stereotypes, particularly of the boy's parents. The writing is uneven, and particularly jarring is the repetition of the phrase "the old man" (as Gordy calls his father) as often as seven times on one page. References to Gordy's brother Stu raise questions that are unresolved here. Readers of Hahn's Stepping on the Cracks (Clarion, 1991), a companion to this book, do know Stu's fate, however, and will be interested in Gordy's story despite its flaws.<br><i>Marie Orlando, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Through the years in old Winnsboro</h2><p>History of Winnsboro, South Carolina.</p><p></p><h2>Daily Grams: Guided Review Aiding Mastery Skill, Grade 3</h2><p>180 Daily reviews: Capitalization, Punctuation, Grammar and other concepts, Daily Sentence Combining.</p><p></p><h2>A Royal Experiment: Love and Duty, Madness and Betrayal&#x2015;the Private Lives of King George III and Queen Charlotte</h2><p><p><b>The stunning debut of an important new history writer</b></p><p>In this magnificent biography of a marriage-between Great Britain's King George III and Queen Charlotte-Janice Hadlow exposes with astonishing emotional force King George's attempt to achieve what none of his forebears had accomplished: a happy family life.</p><p>To Americans, King George III has long been doubly famous-as the "tyrant" from whom colonial revolutionaries wrested their nation's liberty and, owing to his late-life illness, as "the mad king."

His opinions on social and foreign policy, law, education and race, among other topics, reflect a generally conservative, realistic approach to problems that, he notes, result more often in political tradeoffs than so-called solutions advocated by "deep thinkers." His most acerbic comments concern special-interest groups such as homosexual lobbies, bigoted crusaders of all kinds, the welfare system, pay equity and sex education. He supports Reagan's strong anti-Communism, defense and South African policies, along with the president's selection of judges and opposition to judicial activism. Sowell also favors legalization of drugs and equal opportunity over affirmative action. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.This anthology of recent pieces by Sowell, a brilliant economist currently at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, is drawn from his Scripps-Howard syndicated column and his contributions to the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post. While Sowell, who is black, is known as an expert in the economics and politics of race, he is also a thinker of wide-ranging interestsas attested by these provocative writings organized under headings such as "Education," "The Law," and "Foreign Policy." What ties the essays together is his ability to look at the cost and benefits of various concepts, proposals, and actions (comparable worth, judicial activism, etc.) and analyze the trade-offs with common sense.

Most impressive are the effigy mounds, huge earthworks sculpted into the shapes of birds, animals, and other forms, not found anywhere else in the world in such concentrations. This book, written for general readers but incorporating the most recent research, offers a comprehensive overview of these intriguing earthworks and answers the questions, Who built the mounds? When and why were they built?<br>The archaeological record indicates that most ancient societies in the upper Midwest built mounds of various kinds sometime between about 800 B.C. and A.D. 1200; the effigy mounds were probably built between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1200. Using evidence drawn from archaeology, ethnography, ethnohistory, the traditions and beliefs of present-day Native Americans in the Midwest, and recent research and theories of other archaeologists, Birmingham and Eisenberg present an important new interpretation of the effigy mound groups as "cosmological maps" that model ancient belief systems and social relations. It is likely that the distant ancestors of several present-day Native American groups were among the mound-building societies, in part because these groups&#x2019; current clan structures and beliefs are similar to the symbolism represented in the effigy mounds.<br><i>Indian Mounds of Wisconsin</i> includes a travel guide to sites that can be visited by the public, including many in state, county, and local parks.<br></p><p>Robert A. Birmingham is the state archaeologist in the Division of Historic Preservation and Leslie E. Eisenberg is a forensic anthropologist and coordinator of the Burial Sites Preservation Program, both at the State Historical Society of Wisconsin.Throughout history, the mound-builder societies of the many Native American cultures have captured many people's attention. The indigenous mound-building society in Wisconsin, known as the Ho-Chunk, or Winnebago, and the Ioway people were two of the most prolific in the U.S. Because of the increased requests for information, Birmingham and Eisenberg have completed one of the most comprehensive guides to the mounds of Wisconsin. Previously, none of the information on the mounds or their builders was available in a complete volume. Beginning with Wisconsin's early occupants, this work details 2,000 years of history, from pre-mound-builder groups to the modern era. Throughout the book, there are photographs, maps, and detailed drawings of artifacts, people, and the mounds. Included in the appendix is a listing of mound sites open to the public. <i>Indian Mounds </i>is an important and necessary addition to any collection on Native American cultures and the early history of the Midwest. <i>Julia Glynn</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

So when Kroger attends a conference in Germany, Monk hits the skids, reverting to his OCD habits full-time. Desperate, Monk follows his shrink to Germany. And that�'s when he sees the man across a crowded town square. A man with six fingers.

In addition to the original <i>Monk</i> novels, he is also the author of the acclaimed <i>Diagnosis Murder</i> series based on the show for which he was a writer and executive producer.The sixth novel (after 2007's Mr. Monk in Outer Space) based on the popular Monk TV series created by Andy Breckman effectively meets the challenges of translating the screen concept to the page. Monk, an extreme sufferer of obsessive-compulsive disorder who left the San Francisco police department after his journalist wife, Trudy, was killed in a car bombing, decides to accompany his psychotherapist, Dr. Kroger, to a professional conference in Germany so that he won't miss his weekly therapy session. Once in Germany, Monk spots a six-fingered man he believes may have ordered the hit on Trudy. The discovery that the man is an old acquaintance of his psychotherapist leads Monk to investigate Kroger as well. Despite the lack of the TV series' visual humor and the performance of actor Tony Shalhoub, Goldberg does a decent job of conveying both the sleuth's quirks and his genius. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The sternwheelers became gold-rush icons. But the hardy, pragmatic riverboat men were lured by profits, not romance. It was a tough, risky business. The season was short. A navigation error could sink or strand an enormous investment. The steamboats consumed huge amounts of firewood. And if a riverboat didn&#39;t find a safe berth or dry dock before freeze up, it risked being crushed by ice the following spring.</p><p>The year is 1901. trader E.T. Barnette's Riverboat, the Arctic Bay, has urn into a rock and sunk and St. Michaels near the mouth of the Yukon River. Barnette hires C.W. (Charles) Adams for $6,000 to carry Barnette and his party, plus 130 tons of trading goods up the Yukon and Tanana rivers aboard the Lavelle Young to a crossing on the Valdez-to-Eagle Trail. There, Barneete plans to open a trading post hoping ot profit from the needs of gold stampeders headed for the Klondike. The deal struck between Barnette and Adams contains a fateful clause. If, on teh way to the upper Tanana, river conditions prevent passage by the Lavelle Young, Adams has the option to unload Barnette and his supplies on the spot. The sternwheeler has no steam winch or "walking legs" to pull herself out of tight spots, and Adams is afraid his steamboat will become stuck and not be able to return downrive before the onset of winter. As feared, teh Lavelle Young becomes high-centered in the Chena Slough while attempting a side passage around an impassable stretch of the Tanana. Shortly thereafter, Adams leaves an angry Barnette and his sobbing wife on a high bank where Barnette builds a trading post that becomes Fairbanks, Alaska. The rest, as they say, is history. Barely in his mid-20s and owning a majority interest in the Lavelle Young, but not yet its captain, C.W. Adams plays a crucial role in the founding of what today is Alaska's second-largest city and indirectly influenced the economic, political, and demographic transformation of the territory. Capt. Adams left a book manuscript, "A Cheechako Goes to the Klondike," which adds new details about the settlement of Fairbanks and fascinating insight into the business of river boating in the North. <br>The Klondike Stampede caused a transportation boom in the north, where in its thrilling heyday about 250 wooden steamboats operated in the Yukon River drainage of Alaska and the Yukon. The sternwheelers became gold rush icons. But the hardy, pragmatic entrepreneurs who ran the boats were lured by profits, not romance. In 1901, a passenger&#39;s fare from St. Michael to Dawson (about 1,800 miles) was $125, and cargo was moved upriver at $100 a ton. Yet it was a tough, risky business. The season was short, good crews were hard to find, and a navigation error could sink or strand an investment worth tens of thousands of dollars -- huge sums at the turn of the century. Mechanical problems were occupational hazards. The steamboats consumed enormous amounts of firewood for their boilers. And if a riverboat didn&#39;t find a safe berth or drydock before freezeup, it risked being crushed by ice the following spring. Charles W. Adams was an able, smart business college graduate who bought a share of the Lavelle Young in his mid-20s. He became one of the North&#39;s great riverboat captains, lived enough adventure in the north to fill several lifetimes, and played a crucial role in the founding of Fairbanks, Alaska. This first book in the Alaska Heritage Library series preserves the captain&#39;s richly detailed and historically important journal. The Alaska Heritage Library Series is a project of the John D.

She and Master vampire Ethan Sullivan have helped make Cadogan&#x2019;s vampires the strongest in North America, and forged ties with paranormal folk of all breeds and creeds, living or dead...or both.<br><br>But now those alliances are about to be tested. A strange and twisted magic has ripped through the North American Central Pack, and Merit&#x2019;s closest friends are caught in the cross-hairs. Gabriel Keene, the Pack Apex, looks to Merit and Ethan for help. But who&#x2014;or what&#x2014;could possibly be powerful enough to out-magic a shifter?</p><p><b>Chloe Neill </b>was born and raised in the South, but now makes her home in the Midwest.&nbsp;She&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the Chicagoland Vampires series, the Heirs of Chicagoland series, the Dark Elite series, and the Devil's Isle series.Within the last ten months, I&#x2019;d become a vampire, joined Chicago&#x2019;s Cadogan House, and become its Sentinel.<p>I'd learned how to wield a sword, how to bluff a monster, how to fall, and how to get back up.</p><p>Perhaps most of all, I'd learned about loyalty. And based on the magic that was pouring through the House's first-floor hallway, I hadn't been the only one who'd taken that particular quality to heart.</p><p>Dozens of Cadogan's vampires stood in the hallway outside the office of our Master, Ethan Sullivan, waiting for a call, for a word, for a plan. We stood in our requisite Cadogan black with our katanas at our sides because Ethan-our Liege and my lover� was preparing to run.</p><p>"Out of one fire and right into another," said the attractive blond vampire beside me. Lindsey was a member of Cadogan's guard corps and a skilled and capable fighter, but tonight she looked, as usual, more like a fashionista than a century-old vampire guard. She'd left her suit jacket downstairs and had matched her satin-striped black tuxedo pants with a white button-down and four-inch stiletto heels.</p><p>&#x201c;Do they actually think we&#x2019;d just let them take him?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;That we&#x2019;d let them arrest him&#x2014;our <i>Master</i>&#x2014;right there in front of the House?&#x201d;</p><p>An hour ago, a Chicago Police Department detective&#x2014;fortunately, one of our allies&#x2014;had come calling, advising us that the city&#x2019;s prosecutor had obtained a warrant for Ethan&#x2019;s arrest.</p><p>Ethan had killed Harold Monmonth, a powerful vampire from Europe who&#x2019;d murdered two human guards before turning his sword on us. Ethan had acted in obvious self-defense, but violence had recently rocked the Windy City. Its citizens were afraid, and its mayor, Diane Kowalcyzk, was looking for someone to blame. She&#x2019;d apparently managed to bring the prosecutor to her side.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why Ethan was sequestered in his office with Luc, the captain of Cadogan&#x2019;s guards, and Malik, the House&#x2019;s second in command, making a plan.</p><p>Detective Jacobs suggested Ethan seek refuge with the Breck- enridges, a family of shape-shifters who lived in Loring Park, a suburb outside Chicago. That meant he&#x2019;d also be outside the mayor&#x2019;s jurisdiction. The Brecks were �ber-wealthy, well con- nected, and politically influential. That was a powerful combi- nation and enough, we hoped, to keep the mayor from using him as a sacrificial lamb.</p><p>Papa Breck, the family patriarch, was a friend of my father, Chicago real estate mogul Joshua Merit. I&#x2019;d gone to school with some of the Breckenridge boys and had even dated one of them. But the Brecks had no love for vampires, which was part of the reason for the closed-door negotiations.</p><p>Ethan was the other reason. He was nearly four centuries old, and he had the stubbornness to match his age. Going gently into that good night wasn&#x2019;t his style, but Luc and Malik wanted him safely away. It had been a long winter for the House&#x2014; including Ethan&#x2019;s premature demise and resurrection&#x2014;and we didn&#x2019;t need any more drama. We certainly didn&#x2019;t trust Kowalcyzk and feared turning Ethan over to a justice system that seemed to be rigged against us.</p><p>The door had been closed for an hour. Voices had been raised, and the disagreement between Ethan and his soldiers spilled tense magic into the hallway. That was my particular point of con- tention. I was Cadogan&#x2019;s Sentinel, but I hadn&#x2019;t been allowed in the office. The words &#x201c;plausible deniability&#x201d; had been thrown around&#x2014;right before the door had been shut in my face.</p><p>&#x201c;The mayor knew there&#x2019;d be trouble,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The CPD al- ready said Ethan acted in self-defense. And we just handed McKetrick to them on a silver platter. The city has absolutely nothing to complain about where we&#x2019;re concerned.&#x201d;</p><p>The detective&#x2019;s warning had come only hours after we&#x2019;d managed to prove McKetrick, the city&#x2019;s now former supernatural liaison, was the source of the riots that had spread violence, de- struction, and fire around the city. You&#x2019;d think that would have put us in the mayor&#x2019;s good graces. Alas, no.</p><p>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t stay away forever,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Jacobs wouldn&#x2019;t have warned us if he didn&#x2019;t think they were serious. And that doesn&#x2019;t give us many options. Ethan flees, or we have to fight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever their next move, the House will be ready,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;We just have to scoot Ethan out of here.&#x201d; She checked a delicate gold watch. &#x201c;Not much time before sunrise. This is going to be close.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Papa Breck could still say no,&#x201d; I pointed out, wrapping my arms around my knees. He and Ethan were different sups, but equally stubborn.</p><br><p>But Lindsey shook her head. &#x201c;Not if he&#x2019;s smart. Arresting a vampire for a bullshit reason isn&#x2019;t far from arresting a shifter for a bullshit reason. If Papa Breck doesn&#x2019;t take a stand now, he&#x2019;ll put the Pack at risk. But if he does take a stand?&#x201d; She clucked her tongue. &#x201c;Then he wins, double or nothing. We&#x2019;ll owe him a favor, <i>and </i>he&#x2019;ll have stood up to Kowalcyzk. That reinforces his power, and it&#x2019;s just&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Before she could finish, the office door opened.</p><p>Luc and Malik emerged, Ethan behind them. All three were tall and bore the toughened shoulders of men in charge, but the physical similarities ended there.</p><p>Luc had tousled blond-brown hair and preferred snug jeans and well-worn boots to Ethan&#x2019;s and Malik&#x2019;s exquisite suits. Since Ethan&#x2019;s welfare fell under his jurisdiction, Luc&#x2019;s ruggedly hand- some features were tight with concern.</p><p>Malik had cocoa skin, closely cropped hair, and pale green eyes that thoughtfully took in the hallway of vampires. Malik was reserved, careful, and unquestionably respected by the House. But like Luc, he also didn&#x2019;t look thrilled with the circumstances.</p><p>And then there was Ethan.</p><p>He was built like an athlete&#x2014;long and lean, with taut muscles and a body that fit perfectly into his trim black suit. His hair was straight, shoulder length, and golden, framing a face so gorgeous it might have been sculpted by a master artist. Straight nose, honed cheekbones, lush mouth, and eyes as sharp and green as flawless emeralds. Ethan was as alpha as they came, protective and preten- tious, intelligent and strategic, and stubborn enough to match me well.</p><p>We&#x2019;d had our false starts, but we&#x2019;d finally found a clear path to each other. That might have been the biggest miracle of all.</p><p>Ethan&#x2019;s forehead was pinched in concern, but his eyes gave away nothing. He was the Master of our House; he didn&#x2019;t have the luxury of self-doubt.</p><p>A dozen vampires jumped to their feet.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be traveling to the Breckenridge estate,&#x201d; Ethan an- nounced. &#x201c;Cadogan vampires do not run. We do not hide. We do not scurry into the dark. We face our problems&#x2014;head-on. But this House has been through much of late. I have been asked, for the sake of the House, to consider making myself scarce. I have agreed to do so&#x2014;as a temporary measure.&#x201d;</p><p>The tension in my chest eased, but not by much. He clearly wasn&#x2019;t thrilled with the plan.</p><p>&#x201c;In the meantime, we&#x2019;ll try to put this ugly business to bed. The House&#x2019;s lawyers will address the warrant. Malik has a friend in the governor&#x2019;s office, and he&#x2019;ll reach out to determine if the governor can encourage Mayor Kowalcyzk to act reasonably.&#x201d;</p><p>That was news to me, but then again, Malik was the quiet sort. And I didn&#x2019;t think he was the type to call in a political favor unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll take Merit to the Brecks&#x2019;?&#x201d; Lindsey asked. &#x201c;Assuming she can fit it into her schedule,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Drama or not, there was always time for snark in Cadogan House.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll manage,&#x201d; I assured him, &#x201c;although I hate to leave my grandfather here.&#x201d;</p><p>My grandfather was Chicago&#x2019;s former supernatural liaison&#x2014; emphasis on the &#x201c;former&#x201d;&#x2014;but he and his employees, Catcher Bell and Jeff Christopher, still helped the CPD with supernatural issues. Because he&#x2019;d helped us investigate the riots, McKetrick had targeted him. Grandpa&#x2019;s house had been firebombed, and he&#x2019;d been caught in the explosion. He was recovering, but he was still in the hospital. He&#x2019;d been more of a father to me than my</p><br><p>actual father, and although he had people to protect him, I felt guilty leaving while he was out of service.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll check in on him,&#x201d; Luc promised. &#x201c;Give you updates.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In that case,&#x201d; Ethan said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll leave shortly. Malik has the House. And as you know, he makes a very capable Master when I&#x2019;m . . . indisposed.&#x201d;</p><p>There were appreciative chuckles in the crowd. It wasn&#x2019;t Ma- lik&#x2019;s first rodeo as Master; he&#x2019;d held the job when Ethan hadn&#x2019;t been among the living.</p><p>&#x201c;I will be honest. This may not work. We are betting that Diane Kowalcyzk is politically ambitious enough to not cross the Breckenridge family. That gambit could prove incorrect. Either way, our relationship with the city of Chicago could get worse before it gets better. But we are, and we will remain, Cadogan vampires.&#x201d;</p><p>He arched an eyebrow, a habit he used frequently and usually with good effect. &#x201c;Of course, those Cadogan vampires should be at work right now, not eavesdropping outside their Master&#x2019;s office.&#x201d;</p><p>Smiling and appropriately chastised, the vampires dispersed, of- fering good-byes to their Liege as they passed. Margot, the House&#x2019;s brilliant chef, squeezed my hand, then headed down the hallway toward the kitchen.</p><p>Malik, Luc, Lindsey, and I stepped inside Ethan&#x2019;s office. He looked over his staff.</p><p>&#x201c;We have a brief reprieve,&#x201d; Ethan said, &#x201c;but the city may come knocking again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The House is ready,&#x201d; Luc said. &#x201c;Lakshmi, however, is still on her way. We couldn&#x2019;t convince her to delay.&#x201d;</p><p>That was another sticky situation. Cadogan was no longer a member of the Greenwich Presidium, the organization that ruled</p><br><p>North American and Western European vampire houses. Mon- month had been one of its members. The GP was no friend of Cadogan House, and they apparently weren&#x2019;t willing to ignore the fact that we were now responsible for the deaths of two of their members. While we were no longer concerned about their opinion of us, they made powerful and dangerous enemies.</p><p>Lakshmi, one of the remaining GP members, was traveling to Chicago to render its verdict. It probably helped that she was one of the more commonsensical members of the GP, but it was odd that she was traveling while Darius West, the GP head, stayed under the radar in London. He&#x2019;d been a political nonentity since an attack by a vampire assassin relieved him of his confidence, or so we surmised.</p><p>As it turned out, Lakshmi also was a friend to the Red Guard, the secret organization that kept watch on the Houses and their Masters. I was a new member, partnered with the guard captain from Grey House, Jonah. Lakshmi had provided insider infor- mation about GP shenanigans; in return for her help, I&#x2019;d offered an unspecified favor. It was inevitable she&#x2019;d attempt to collect; vampires were particular that way.</p><p>&#x201c;Keep her out of the House,&#x201d; Ethan said. &#x201c;We aren&#x2019;t members of the GP, and she has no business in our domain. She may have a legitimate claim to reparations, but that can be dealt with when we&#x2019;ve dealt with the city.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I spoke with Lakshmi&#x2019;s majordomo,&#x201d; Luc said, &#x201c;tried to winnow information out of her. She wouldn&#x2019;t budge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll deal with it when we deal with it,&#x201d; Ethan said. &#x201c;This entire situation is fraught with hazard.&#x201d;</p><p>Malik nodded. &#x201c;It all comes down to who blinks first.&#x201d;</p><p>Ethan&#x2019;s eyes flattened. &#x201c;Whatever happens, Cadogan House will not blink first.&#x201d;</p><br><p>We lived in Chicago, which meant off-street parking spots were hard to come by and the objects of envy. The House&#x2019;s coveted underground parking lot was accessible through the basement, so we headed downstairs. Ethan keyed the security pad at the door and stepped inside the basement but, when the heavy door closed behind us, dropped his duffel and grabbed my hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Come here,&#x201d; he said, voice heavy with desire. He didn&#x2019;t wait for my response, but caught me by surprise, his mouth on mine, his hands at my waist, suddenly insistent.</p><p>I was nearly out of breath when he finally released me. &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; I barely managed to ask.</p><p>Ethan brushed a lock of hair behind my ear. &#x201c;I had need of you, Sentinel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got me,&#x201d; I assured him with a smile. &#x201c;But at the moment, we have need of speed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not your best work,&#x201d; he cannily said, but he put a hand on my cheek and gazed into my eyes as if he might discover the world&#x2019;s secrets there. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m nervous about leaving,&#x201d; I admitted. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re worried about your grandfather.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;He was asleep when I called. He&#x2019;ll understand&#x2014; he always does. I just wish I didn&#x2019;t have to ask him to be under- standing.&#x201d;</p><p>Ethan kissed my brow. &#x201c;You are a good granddaughter, Car- oline Evelyn Merit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure about that. But I&#x2019;m trying.&#x201d; Sometimes, that was the best a girl could do.</p><p>I gestured toward the gleaming silver bullet that sat in the House&#x2019;s visitor spot, the antique Mercedes roadster Ethan had bought for me from the Pack leader himself. She was sweet and perfectly restored, and I called her Moneypenny. She was also still registered in Gabriel&#x2019;s name, which seemed a better transpor- tation option than taking Ethan&#x2019;s car. But since he had decades&#x2019; more driving experience than me&#x2014;and we were in a hurry&#x2014;I held out the keys.</p><p>&#x201c;Shall we?&#x201d;</p><p>Ethan&#x2019;s eyes widened with delight. He&#x2019;d been attempting to buy Moneypenny for years and had probably wanted to slide behind the wheel for even longer.</p><p>&#x201c;If we&#x2019;re going to run,&#x201d; he said, taking the keys from me, a spark jumping across our fingertips as they brushed, &#x201c;we might as well escape in style.&#x201d;</p><p>Sometimes that was the best a vampire could do.</p></p><h2>Worlds Worst Children 2 EXPORT</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

He has also traveled with other rock bands and artists, including Black Sabbath, The Who, Eric Clapton, The Yardbirds, Ozzy Osbourne, and, most recently, Crazy Town. He now divides his time between Venice, California, and London.</p>Tell-all journal of the hedonism, profligacy, and perversity of the Seventies supergroup that went down in flames. Led Zeppelin was assembled by former Yardbirds guitarist Jimmy Page; 14 months after their first performance, they had a recording contract with Atlantic, were playing 20,000 seat arenas, and had been offered a million dollars for a single performance. Cole (here ably assisted by journalist Trubo) was the group's tour manager and road companion for 12 years. What happens when four men, some not yet of majority, become rich as Croesus in 20 months, have more women than imaginable throwing themselves at their feet, and unlimited alcohol, drugs, and servants as well? Cole is astoundingly clear on the details- -offhandedly honest as he is about his own gargantuan appetite for heroin and booze--and lays out the road life with all the real nitty-gritty, including the 14-year-olds Page craved, room demolitions, cross-dressing, and the infamous fornication-by-fish episode. The inevitable center of gravity of Cole's saga is the tragedy of John ``Bonzo'' Bonham, the band's drummer, dead of alcohol overdose at age 32. Bonham--a monster with his addiction fully blown, his short life drowning in a sea of alcohol--is by turns grandiose, despairing, manipulative, passionate, violent. Invited backstage to a Ten Years After Concert, he throws orange juice on Alvin Lee--the most respected guitarist of his generation--as Lee performs, then staggers on stage and rips his clothes off, defecates in women's handbags and shoes, and passes out in the gutter outside his $500 hotel room. And everywhere around him are the enablers, feeding him more alcohol, cocaine, heroin. Lacks the depth of Stephen Davis's Hammer of the Gods (1985) but dishes up the real dirt as only an insider's report can. (Photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this dramatic and explosive book, award-winning <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Bob Drogin delivers a narrative that takes us to Europe, the Middle East, and deep inside the CIA to find the truth&#x2013;the truth about the lies and self-deception that led us into a military and political nightmare.<br><br>In 1999, a mysterious Iraqi applies for political asylum in Munich. The young chemical engineer offers compelling testimony of Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s secret program to build weapons of mass destruction. He claims that the dictator has constructed germ factories on trucks, creating a deadly hell on wheels. His grateful German hosts pass his account to their CIA counterparts but deny the Americans access to their superstar informant.

Determined to invade, Bush&#x2019;s people seize on Curveball&#x2019;s story about mobile germ labs&#x2013;even though it has begun to unravel. Ignoring a flood of warnings about the informant&#x2019;s credibility, the CIA allows President Bush to cite Curveball&#x2019;s unconfirmed claims in a State of the Union speech. Finally, Secretary of State Colin Powell highlights the Iraqi&#x2019;s &#x201c;eyewitness&#x201d; account during his historic address to the U.N. Security Council.

He lives with his wife and two children outside Washington, D.C.Staring out the window, Ahmed Hassan Mohammed could see little of his new home.<br>In the spring or summer, arriving passengers at Munich's Franz Josef Strauss International Airport normally glimpse the rugged foothills of the Bavarian Alps jutting above the horizon. The distant mountains gleam softly in the morning light, and shimmer in the rich pastels of the setting sun.<br>But in November 1999, when Ahmed's plane landed, gray mist usually veiled the view. On most days, heavy clouds swirled across the leaden sky. Rain pelted down from passing squalls and driving storms. Sharp gusts skittered across the runway puddles and flattened the nearby grass. Droplets streamed down the windows like tears.<br>Ahmed's plane ?ew from North Africa, and the stale air in the cabin would smell of sweet anise and cheap cologne. Foreign workers heading home traveled heavy and happy. They forgot their dismal jobs and cramped ?ats. They shrugged off the suspicious eyes and sudden silences in German shops. Their bags betrayed their new riches. They hauled television sets and fancy stereos. They dragged cheap suitcases, cardboard boxes wrapped with rope, and plastic sacks full of duty-free cigarettes. But the return ?ights, like this one, from the desert villages and urban slums of Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, seemed sadder. The men brought back stuffed dates and preserved lemons, kif candy and almond cookies. They suffused the plane with the scent of regret and wrenching farewells.<br>The airplane aisle ?lled quickly as passengers climbed out of their seats and yanked overstuffed bags down from overhead bins. They pulled on worn leather coats and thick ski parkas. They pushed their tired children and each other toward the exit door and shuf?ed down the metal stairs. Ahmed followed.<br>Airport workers in neon yellow slickers scurried near the plane. Utility vehicles painted cautionary orange chugged and hauled silver containers bulging with bags. Boxy white Sky Chefs delivery trucks disgorged supplies or took others on. Airport vans, all the same olive green, rushed in one direction and then back again. Ahmed couldn't help but notice. Germany was so orderly. So color-coordinated. So different from the cacophony of life back home. An elongated blue bus, the two parts joined by a black rubber accordion neck, pulled up beside the plane. On the side, black letters read "Flughafen Munchen." Munich Airport.<br>He boarded the bus to the terminal for international arrivals and was swept along as the throng pushed inside. White acoustic tiles and the drone of hidden machinery suddenly muffled the crowd's chatter. He stepped on a moving sidewalk that glided silently past glittering ads for gold watches, sleek cars, and high-priced appliances. Gorgeous women, tall and young, beckoned to him from the posters. The light was blindingly bright.<br>The long hall emptied into a smaller area, where other passengers already were shuffling into lines in front of four booths. A large sign on top read, Passkontrolle&#x2013;Alle Posse. Ahmed didn't speak German, but a translation was posted underneath in English and he could read and write enough of that. Passport Control&#x2013;All Passports. Each booth featured a large glass window at eye level, but the lower portion was frosted white so someone waiting in line or even standing a foot away could only see the face and chest of the federal border police officer sitting inside. The officer wore a starched, military-style khaki shirt and a white plastic ID card in a red border hung from the right pocket. Small stars embroidered his shoulder boards. A patch on the left shoulder read "Polizei."<br>The long line moved slowly, but the traveler was patient. He knew how to wait in submissive silence for hard-eyed men in military uniforms. Finally his turn came. He steeled himself and stepped up to the window. The officer inside could extend his right arm and his open palm would appear in a small, semicircular opening. Ahmed handed his dark brown passport to the pink fingers that suddenly poked out.<br>The document was from Iraq, issued in Baghdad. Lea?ng through the stiff pages, the officer could see several large, colorful visas, plus the usual entry and exit stamps. Small countries invariably issue the biggest, most ?orid visas, perhaps to compensate for their insigni?cance.<br>These showed he had visited Turkey and, more recently, Jordan, Cyprus, Morocco, and Spain, traveling for about six months. His passport held no visa for Germany.<br>Just outside each booth, a rectangular mirror hung on a metal arm from the ceiling. It was positioned so the border officer could tilt his head and peer up to his right, and get a clear view of the applicant waiting in front of him. This one didn't stand out.<br>He was a good-looking man, solidly built, of olive complexion and medium height. He looked in his late twenties, perhaps a little older. He had jet black hair, parted on the left, and a thick shock draped low on his forehead. His eyes were large and heavy-lidded, pensive and brooding, set far apart. A broad, hawkish nose sat over full lips and a strong chin. A full mustache curled around the corners of his mouth like a sneer. It seemed notable only because most Iraqi men raised shaggy brush mustaches to mimic Saddam. Perhaps he was cold, or tense, but the traveler seemed to tremble. Later, German intelligence authorities would say he often quivered with nervous energy.<br>The border officer studied the document and then looked up at the Iraqi. Ahmed would have stared back. He usually held people in a frank gaze, tilting his head just so. It conjured an impression of serious endeavor. If he ?ashed a shy smile, as he often did, the officer would have noticed teeth stained with tobacco tar. Ahmed didn't just smoke. He embraced the habit, almost tenderly. He carefully cupped his lighter with his slender ?ngers, as if facing a vigorous wind. Then he ?icked the blue ?ame alive, closed his dark eyes, and leaned back, letting the smoke wreathe up to caress his face.<br>No record was kept of their conversation, but it would be brief and to the point.<br>Where is your visa? The border officer spoke in English. Few Iraqis knew decent German.<br>Please, I want political asylum. He replied in slow, thickly accented English. Few Germans spoke any Arabic.<br>The officer was not, as one might think, surprised. Germany was the travel hub of modern Europe and its economy was booming. Every day&#x2013;every hour&#x2013;refugees showed up from one hellhole or another and appealed for safe haven from war, famine, ethnic persecution, and political oppression. Nearly half of all refugees who applied for asylum in the promised lands of Western Europe ?led their claims in Germany. Immigration records showed 7,476 people sought asylum in Germany the month Ahmed arrived. A total of 95,113 ?ooded in that year.<br>Most ?ed the vicious civil war in the Balkans, then rupturing along ethnic fault lines. But southern Germany also was refuge of choice for Iraqis on the run. Thousands ?owed in each year, wave upon wave of businessmen, engineers, scientists, and soldiers, all ?eeing Saddam's tyranny. More than sixty thousand Iraqi refugees and emigres lived in Germany, and at least half of them clustered around the cities of Munich, Nuremberg, and Augsburg in the southern state of Bavaria.<br>They had good reason to come. Germany provided greater bene?ts to refugees than nearly any other nation in Europe. It was especially tolerant and benevolent to those seeking sanctuary from the misery of Iraq. Saddam's secret police picked up and tortured people at whim, or shot them in front of their homes and hung the bodies from lampposts. The U.N. had imposed strict military and economic sanctions, and guilt-stricken postwar Germany wasn't going to forcibly repatriate anyone to one of the most repressive regimes on the planet.<br>The border officer pressed a button on his desk, and another man in a starched khaki shirt appeared and escorted the traveler across the hall to a small of?ce with a desk. Ahmed sat down on a hard metal chair, and an Arabic translator soon arrived so the German officer could ask a series of questions and take down the answers. German of?cials later would describe the story that Ahmed blurted out in a smoker's voice, thick and gravelly.<br>I am from Baghdad, northeast Baghdad. I live with my mother and father. I am a chemical engineer. I attended the University of Baghdad. I worked at the government Chemical Engineering and Design Center. I worked in a program to help Iraqi farmers. We improved their seeds.<br>Yes, I am married. No, she is still in Baghdad. Ahmed Hassan Mohammed is a false name. I used this passport to escape Iraq. I cannot go back. I am against Saddam. They know this. I had serious problems with the authorities. If I go back, they will put me in prison and torture or kill me.<br>The lengthy interview and paperwork took several hours but the translator ?nally wrote out careful instructions and helped Ahmed buy the necessary bus and train tickets at a kiosk just outside the customs hall so he wouldn't get lost. Clutching the slips of paper and his bag, he walked purposefully through the huge airport to reach the bus stand outside.<br>He boarded the local bus to the town of Friesing, about twenty minutes away past dark russet ?elds lined by thick hedgerows. He got out at the town center and entered a small Tyrolean train station with carved wooden benches and a red-gabled roof, like a model for a toy train set. He descended into a small tunnel under the tracks, and climbed back up into the biting wind on Platform 4. A red suburban train soon roared up, and when the door slid open, he entered the second-class compartment and found a seat. The doors whooshed to a close, and the train roared away again on the two-hour journey to Nuremberg.<br>From the train, Ahmed could see rolling hills, ice-?ecked rivers, and desolate winter ?elds of rapeseed and ?ax. The view was surprisingly rural. Horses grazed in small paddocks, stamping their feet and snorting steam in the cold air. Every so often, the train entered a deep forest glen, and the light ...</p><h2>Shadowrun 02: Choose Your Enemies Carefully</h2><p>WHEN MAGIC RETURNS TO THE EARTH its power calls Sam Verner.

Crisp baguettes, the flesh of the bread a virginal white, still steaming from the oven, and ripe cheese, its borders creeping toward the edge of the plate. Grapes and plums, stacked high in bowls, dusky and fragrant, their scent filling the air. I was about to reach out and take one, when my sister stopped me. &#x201c;Get off,&#x201d; I murmured. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hungry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sophie. Wake up.&#x201d;</p><p>I could taste that cheese. I was going to have a mouthful of Reblochon, smear it on a hunk of that warm bread, then pop a grape into my mouth. I could already taste the intense sweetness, smell the rich aroma.</p><p>But there it was, my sister&#x2019;s hand on my wrist, stopping me. The plates were disappearing, the scents fading. I reached out to them but they began to pop, like soap bubbles.</p><p>&#x201c;Sophie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>What?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They have Aur�lien!&#x201d;</p><p>I turned onto my side and blinked. My sister was wearing a cotton bonnet, as I was, to keep warm. Her face, even in the feeble light of her candle, was leached of color, her eyes wide with shock. &#x201c;They have Aur�lien. Downstairs.&#x201d;</p><p>My mind began to clear. From below us came the sound of men shouting, their voices bouncing off the stone courtyard, the hens squawking in their coop. In the thick dark, the air vibrated with some terrible purpose. I sat upright in bed, dragging my gown around me, struggling to light the candle on my bedside table.</p><p>I stumbled past her to the window and stared down into the courtyard at the soldiers, illuminated by the headlights of their vehicle, and my younger brother, his arms around his head, trying to avoid the rifle butts that landed blows on him.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They know about the pig.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Monsieur Suel must have informed on us. I heard them shouting from my room. They say they&#x2019;ll take Aur�lien if he doesn&#x2019;t tell them where it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He will say nothing,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>We flinched as we heard our brother cry out. I hardly recognized my sister then: She looked twenty years older than her twenty-four years. I knew her fear was mirrored in my own face. This was what we had dreaded.</p><p>&#x201c;They have a <i>Kommandant</i> with them. If they find it,&#x201d; H�l�ne whispered, her voice cracking with panic, &#x201c;they&#x2019;ll arrest us all. You know what took place in Arras. They&#x2019;ll make an example of us. What will happen to the children?&#x201d;</p><p>My mind raced, fear that my brother might speak out making me stupid. I wrapped a shawl around my shoulders and tiptoed to the window, peering out at the courtyard. The presence of a <i>Kommandant</i> suggested these were not just drunken soldiers looking to take out their frustrations with a few threats and knocks: We were in trouble.</p><p>&#x201c;They will find it, Sophie. It will take them minutes. And then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; H�l�ne&#x2019;s voice rose, lifted by panic.</p><p>My thoughts turned black. I closed my eyes. And then I opened them. &#x201c;Go downstairs,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Plead ignorance. Ask him what Aur�lien has done wrong. Talk to him, distract him. Just give me some time before they come into the house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to do?&#x201d;</p><p>I gripped my sister&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Go. But tell them nothing, you understand? Deny <i>everything</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>My sister hesitated, then ran toward the corridor, her nightgown billowing behind her. I&#x2019;m not sure I had ever felt as alone as I did in those few seconds, fear gripping my throat and the weight of my family&#x2019;s fate upon me. I ran into Father&#x2019;s study and scrabbled in the drawers of the great desk, hurling its contents&#x2014;old pens, scraps of paper, pieces from broken clocks, and ancient bills&#x2014;onto the floor, thanking God when I finally found what I was searching for. Then I ran downstairs, opened the cellar door, and skipped down the cold stone stairs, so surefooted now in the dark that I barely needed the fluttering glow of the candle. I lifted the heavy latch to the back cellar, which had once been stacked to the roof with beer kegs and good wine, slid one of the empty barrels aside, and opened the door of the old cast-iron bread oven.</p><p>The piglet, still only half grown, blinked sleepily. It lifted itself to its feet, peered out at me from its bed of straw, and grunted. Surely I&#x2019;ve told you about the pig? We liberated it during the requisition of Monsieur Girard&#x2019;s farm. Like a gift from God, it had strayed into the chaos, meandering away from the piglets being loaded into the back of a German truck, and was swiftly swallowed by the bulky skirts of Grandma Poil�ne. We&#x2019;ve been fattening it on acorns and scraps for weeks, in the hope of raising it to a size great enough for us all to have some meat. The thought of that crisp skin, that moist pork, has kept the inhabitants of Le Coq Rouge going for the past month.</p><p>Outside I heard my brother yelp again, then my sister&#x2019;s voice, rapid and urgent, cut short by the harsh tones of a German officer. The pig looked at me with intelligent, understanding eyes, as if it already knew its fate.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry, <i>mon petit</i>,&#x201d; I whispered, &#x201c;but this really is the only way.&#x201d; And I brought down my hand.</p><p>I was outside in a matter of moments. I had woken Mimi, telling her only that she must come but to stay silent&#x2014;the child has seen so much these last months that she obeys without question. She glanced up at me holding her baby brother, slid out of bed, and placed a hand in mine.</p><p>The air was crisp with the approach of winter, the smell of woodsmoke lingering in the air from our brief fire earlier in the evening. I saw the <i>Kommandant </i>through the stone archway of the back door and hesitated. It was not Herr Becker, whom we knew and despised. This was a slimmer man, clean-shaven, impassive, watchful. Even in the dark I thought I could detect intelligence, rather than brutish ignorance, in his manner, which made me afraid.</p><p>This new <i>Kommandant</i> was gazing speculatively up at our windows, perhaps considering whether this building might provide a more suitable billet than the Fourrier farm, where the senior German officers slept. I suspect he knew that our elevated aspect would give him a vantage point across the town. There were stables for horses and ten bedrooms, from the days when our home was the town&#x2019;s thriving hotel.</p><p>H�l�ne was on the cobbles, shielding Aur�lien with her arms.</p><p>One of his men had raised his rifle, but the <i>Kommandant </i>lifted his hand. &#x201c;Stand up,&#x201d; he ordered them. H�l�ne scrambled backward, away from him. I glimpsed her face, taut with fear.</p><p>I felt Mimi&#x2019;s hand tighten round mine as she saw her mother, and I gave hers a squeeze, even though my heart was in my mouth. And I strode out. &#x201c;What in God&#x2019;s name is going on?&#x201d; My voice rang out in the yard.</p><p>The <i>Kommandant</i> glanced toward me, surprised by my tone: a young woman walking through the arched entrance to the farmyard, a thumb-sucking child at her skirts, another swaddled and clutched to her chest. My night bonnet sat slightly askew, my white cotton nightgown so worn now that it barely registered as fabric against my skin. I prayed that he could not hear the almost audible thumping of my heart.</p><p>I addressed him directly: &#x201c;And for what supposed misdemeanor have your men come to punish us now?&#x201d;</p><p>I guessed he had not heard a woman speak to him in this way since his last leave home. The silence that fell upon the courtyard was steeped in shock. My brother and sister, on the ground, twisted round, the better to see me, only too aware of where such insubordination might leave us all.</p><p>&#x201c;You are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Madame Lef�vre.&#x201d;</p><p>I could see he was checking for the presence of my wedding ring. He needn&#x2019;t have bothered: Like most women in our area, I had long since sold it for food.</p><p>&#x201c;Madame. We have information that you are harboring illegal livestock.&#x201d; His French was passable, suggesting previous postings in the occupied territory, his voice calm. This was not a man who felt threatened by the unexpected.</p><p>&#x201c;Livestock?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A reliable source tells us that you are keeping a pig on the premises. You will be aware that, under the directive, the penalty for withholding livestock from the administration is imprisonment.&#x201d;</p><p>I held his gaze. &#x201c;And I know exactly who would inform you of such a thing. It&#x2019;s Monsieur Suel, <i>non</i>?&#x201d; My cheeks were flushed with color; my hair, twisted into a long plait that hung over my shoulder, felt electrified. It prickled at the nape of my neck.</p><p>The <i>Kommandant </i>turned to one of his minions. The man&#x2019;s glance sideways told him this was true.</p><p>&#x201c;Monsieur Suel, Herr Kommandant, comes here at least twice a month attempting to persuade us that in the absence of our husbands we are in need of his particular brand of comfort. Because we have chosen not to avail ourselves of his supposed kindness, he repays us with rumors and a threat to our lives.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The authorities would not act unless the source was credible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would argue, Herr Kommandant, that this visit suggests otherwise.&#x201d;</p><p>The look he gave me was impenetrable. He turned on his heel and walked toward the house door. I followed him, half tripping over my skirts in my attempt to keep up. I knew the mere act of speaking so boldly to him might be considered a crime. And yet, at that moment, I was no longer afraid.</p><p>&#x201c;Look at us, <i>Kommandant</i>. Do we look as though we are feasting on beef, on roast lamb, on filet of pork?&#x201d; He turned, his eyes flicking toward my bony wrists, just visible at the sleeves of my gown. I had lost two inches from my waist in the last year alone. &#x201c;Are we grotesquely plump with the bounty of our hotel? We have three hens left of two dozen. Three hens that we have the pleasure of keeping and feeding so that your men might take the eggs. We, meanwhile, live on what the German authorities deem to be a diet&#x2014;decreasing rations of meat and flour, and bread made from grit and bran so poor we would not use it to feed livestock.&#x201d;</p><p>He was in the back hallway, his heels echoing on the flagstones. He hesitated, then walked through to the bar and barked an order. A soldier appeared from nowhere and handed him a lamp.</p><p>&#x201c;We have no milk to feed our babies, our children weep with hunger, we become ill from lack of nutrition. And still you come here in the middle of the night to terrify two women and brutalize an innocent boy, to beat us and threaten us, because you heard a rumor from an immoral man that we were <i>feasting</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>My hands were shaking. He saw the baby squirm, and I realized I was so tense that I was holding it too tightly. I stepped back, adjusted the shawl, crooned to it. Then I lifted my head. I could not hide the bitterness and anger in my voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Search our home, then, <i>Kommandant</i>. Turn it upside down and destroy what little has not already been destroyed. Search all the outbuildings, too, those that your men have not already stripped for their own wants. When you find this mythical pig, I hope your men dine well on it.&#x201d;</p><p>I held his gaze for just a moment longer than he might have expected. Through the window I could make out my sister wiping Aur�lien&#x2019;s wounds with her skirts, trying to stem the blood. Three German soldiers stood over them.</p><p>My eyes were used to the dark now, and I saw that the <i>Kommandant</i> was wrong-footed. His men, their eyes uncertain, were waiting for him to give the orders. He could instruct them to strip our house to the beams and arrest us all to pay for my extraordinary outburst. But I knew he was thinking of Suel, whether he might have been misled. He did not look the kind of man to relish the possibility of being seen to be wrong.</p><p>When �douard and I used to play poker, he had laughed and said I was an impossible opponent, as my face never revealed my true feelings. I told myself to remember those words now: This was the most important game I would ever play. We stared at each other, the <i>Kommandant </i>and I. I felt, briefly, the whole world still around us: I could hear the distant rumble of the guns at the front, my sister&#x2019;s coughing, the scrabbling of our poor, scrawny hens disturbed in their coop. It faded until just he and I faced each other, each gambling on the truth. I swear I could hear my very heart beating.</p><p>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>He held up the lamp, and it was dimly illuminated in pale gold light: the portrait �douard had painted of me when we were first married. There I was, in that first year, my hair thick and lustrous around my shoulders, my skin clear and blooming, gazing out with the self-possession of the adored. I had brought it down from its hiding place several weeks before, telling my sister I was damned if the Germans would decide what I should look at in my own home.</p><p>He lifted the lamp a little higher so that he could see it more clearly. <i>Do not put it there, Sophie, H�l�ne had warned. It will invite trouble.</i></p><p>When he finally turned to me, it was as if he had had to tear his eyes from it. He looked at my face, then back at the painting. &#x201c;My husband painted it.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t know why I felt the need to tell him that.</p><p>Perhaps it was the certainty of my righ...</p></p><h2>24 Flower Quilt Blocks</h2><p>Your favorite flowers will burst to life when you create these intricately designed, foundation-pieced flower blocks.

And here he has succeeded magnificently. For peacemakers and warmakers alike, <i>Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace</i> is essential reading. (Harry G. Summers, Jr. <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Fascinating...Luttwak succeeds admirably in revealing the complex and invariably contradictory relationship between the various levels of strategic action; our grasp of the <i>process</i> of conflict is correspondingly enhanced and the reader left properly skeptical about claims that his or that technical innovation will provide an ultimate and foolproof defense. Luttwak's achievement is therefore considerable: Like his mentor Clausewitz he has recognized that the study of war cannot be subject to the 'intellectual codification used in the [mechanical] arts and sciences.' Rather, it requires philosophical rigour and historical understanding of a kind rarely found in the narrow, ahistorical world of the scenario builder. These intellectual virtues are abundantly present in this book, and teacher and student alike can only benefit from a close reading and assessment of its central hypothesis. (J. E. Spence <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br>If Edward Luttwak does not always persuade, he always provokes.

It was her hope, as she said, not only to teach us this beautiful language but to be able to bring to life for us the people who formed the vibrant culture that was Rome's.

Set in ancient Rome before the rise of Julius Caesar, these are not your usual cozy reads. His detective, Gordianus the Finder, seems a scruffy sort, not a noble Roman from the history books by any means, and his Rome is a rough-and-tumble place full of noisy street vendors and con artists as well as more well-to-do, upstanding citizens, a city full of gossip and intrigue and nasty politics as vicious as anything we see today. The noble Romans do appear in his books, of course, but they're a far cry from the bloodless statues who watch serenely from the covers of Latin books as students painstakingly translate their dry speeches. Marcus Tullius Cicero, for one, appears in CATILINA'S RIDDLE not as a statesman but as an underhanded schemer obsessed with destroying Lucius Sergius Catilina, who has gone down in history, rightly or wrongly, as a man who attempted to bring down the Roman Republic.

This pattern, Takaki shows, would be imposed on other Asian immigrant groups. Filipinos, condescended to as "little brown brothers" by whites in the Philippines, became targets of violent white backlash once they emigrated to the U.S.; Indians were feared and persecuted as labor competition; Japanese-Americans withdrew into self-contained communities. Takaki, descended from a Japanese-American family who labored on Hawaiian plantations, and now an ethnic studies professor at UC Berkeley, has written a vibrant, rich history that gives back a voice to countless "invisible Americans." His broad, multi-ethnic survey is peopled with real individuals, allowing us to experience their loneliness, separation from families, struggles for survival. Later chapters cover the internment of Japanese-Americans during WW II and the post-1965 "second wave" of Asian immigrants that included Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians.

Six of the dead were Giant employees; three were "replacement workers." All were husbands, fathers, sons, lovers, friends, firefighters, draegermen. Their deaths brought squadrons of police, investigators and the eye of the national media to Yellowknife. Roger Warren, a longtime Giant employee, was convicted on nine counts of second-degree murder. A multi-million dollar civil suit is ongoing. <p> Those were the headlines reported in the nightly news, but as Yellowknife journalists Lee Selleck and Francis Thompson note, the real story of the Giant Mine tragedy was, up until now, untold. </p><p> Utterly compelling and controversial, <b>Dying for Gold</b> is a masterful work of investigative journalism.</p></p><p>Lee Selleck is a reporter/editor with CBC North Television in the North West Territories.

That is the question addressed in this wonderfully illustrated book for "earthlings" who want to explore beyond the cardboard aliens of television science fiction to find out what science says about our cosmic cousins from other planet--if they exist. </p><p> Author Terence Dickinson, an acclaimed astronomy writer, examines t! he picture we have absorbed from TV and movies about creatures from other planets, from the friendly visitor in <i>E.T.</i> to the savage creature in <i>Alien</i> and the gaggle of other-worldly folk from <i>Star Trek</i> and its clones. Dickinson then explains how the variety of environments in the universe could give rise to creature far more different from us than anything Hollywood's invented. </p><p> Through the talents of illustrator Adolf Schaller, one of the chief artists and Emmy-award winner from Carl Sagan's <i>Cosmos</i> television series, alien worlds come alive with plants, insects and animals never dreamed of before. Yet, Schaller's vision is based on sound assumptions about the gravity of each hypothetical planet, the type of star that it orbits and other factors that bring plausible alien environments to life. The book winds up with a look at "life as we don't know it," featuring creatures and entities that might have evolved from something other that carbon-based biology, the foundation of ! Earth life. </p><p> A unique blend of science and imagination, <b>Extraterrestrials</b> will compel anyone who has ever thought about what-and who-might be out there. </p></p><p><p> The best-selling author of "Nightwatch", "Exploring the Night Sky", "The Backyard Astronomer's Guide", "Exploring the Sky by Day", and "From Big Bang to Planet X", <b>Terence Dickinson</b> has received many national and international science awards including the New York Academy of Sciences Book of the Year Award and the Royal Canadian Institute's Sandford Fleming Medal. More than one million of his previous books are in print in three languages. </p>Are We Alone? <p>What will they look like? Extraterrestrials, that is. We've seen lots of aliens on television and in the movies -- everything from Mr. Spock to talking rocks. </p><p>Some of those television and movie aliens look exactly like us. Some are just a bit different, with weird skin color, pointy ears or distorted facial features. Others are bizarre, like the giant walrus-like Jabba the Hutt in the Star Wars movie Return of the Jedi. </p><p>But have you ever wondered whether these aliens actually make sense? What do they eat? What is their home planet like? What type of air do they breathe? </p><p>In this book, we venture beyond the aliens we know from television and the movies and try to be a little more scientific in our approach as we explore what extraterrestrials might be like -- if they exist. We examine the possibilities for life as we know it and travel into the shadowy realm of life as we don't know it. We have tried to blend science and imagination to depict life on other planets. It's a voyage into the possible, if not the probably. </p><p>One thing we do know when we look around us at the other planets in our own solar system is that we don't find worlds with surface conditions anything like the Earth's. Not a drop of water exists on our moon. The nearest planet, Venus, has a surface hot enough to melt lead, even at its poles. Our other nearby planetary neighbor, Mars -- the planet most like Earth -- is a frigid desert world. Mars and Venus are the planets where astronomers expected to find conditions similar to those on Earth. </p><p>In fact, the more we learn about other worlds, the more we realize that an enormous variety of conditions exists out there. Although only a small fraction of those environments could support life as we know it, the universe, as we shall see, is a very big place. </p><p>Imagine that each star in the known universe is represented by a single grain of sand. A thimble would hold all the stars visible on a clear, dark summer night. A large construction wheelbarrow would contain the Milky Way, the galaxy in which our sun resides. But to demonstrate the immense numbers of stars in the universe, we need a freight train with hopper cars filled with sand. As the train begins to speed by us at a level crossing, we count the cars while we wait. The cars roar past, one per second. We would have to keep count 24 hours a day for three years before the universe train had completed its pass. </p><p>If only one star in a billion is parent to a planet with life, then at least one trillion planets in the universe harbor living matter. Suppose that during the history of the Milky Way Galaxy, a few hundred other intelligent technological civilizations arose on places much like Earth. What would these civilizations be like? It's a powerful question -- one that carries the mind to limitless speculation.</p></p><h2>All of Grace: The Infinite Love of God</h2><p>In <i>All of Grace</i>, Charles H.

Though there is no direct translation of the word to English, shibori essentially denotes a shaped-resist textile, and is commonly associated with weaving and dyeing fiber. The world of shibori knitting is vast and relatively unexplored.<br><br><i>Shibori Knits</i> highlights the intersection between shibori and knitting, offering 20 patterns that utilize this transformative technique. Internationally acclaimed knitwear designer Gina Wilde guides knitters through three dynamic ways to add shibori to knitting. The first method uses physical resists (marbles or corks) that prevent specific areas of knitting from felting; where there are no resists, the garment does felt, creating unique fabric with bobbles and dimensionality. Another method uses nonfelting fibers as resists&#x2014;for instance, a silk yarn knit with a wool yarn&#x2014;to create windowpane effects or even mimic woven strips of fabric when felted. The third method creates ruffles and spirals when the fibers are worked in more than one direction; when felted, the work will shrink differently in the alternate directions. The textures created from each method offer a unique way to redefine felting and bring the beautiful and unexpected world of shibori to the knitter.<br><br>Knitters of every skill can explore this exciting method of creating art out of knitting. With detailed information on fibers and their shibori potential, a primer on technical felting concepts, and a thorough resource guide, <i>Shibori Knits</i> shows knitters how to create colorful, sculptural, and delicate projects, transforming knitting into something new.</p><p>GINA WILDE is an innovative knitwear designer and the creative director and cofounder of Alchemy Yarns of Transformation (www.alchemyyarns.com), known for its luscious colors and range of fibers.

He is searching for Delphine, who vanished with only a scrawled-out address on a scrap of paper as a trace. In his newest chiller, Richard Sala takes the tale of Snow White and stands<br>it on its head, retelling it from Prince Charming's perspective (the unnamed traveler) in a contemporary setting. This twisted tale includes all the elements of terror from the original fairy tale, with none of the insipid saccharine coating of the Disney animated adaptation: Yes, there will be blood. <br>Originally serialized as part of the acclaimed international "Ignatz" series, Delphine is executed in a rich and ominous duotone that shows off Sala's virtuosity just as much as last year's full-color post-apocalyptic horror fantasy The Hidden did - punctuated with stunning full-color chapter breaks. <br></p><p>Richard Sala grew up in Chicago. He has an MFA from Mills College, has collaborated with Lemony Snicket, and illustrated a Jack Kerouac script. He spends his time in Berkeley, CA.Comicdom&#x2019;s master of the musty macabre retells (very loosely) the Snow White fairy tale from the point of view of a modern Prince Charming. With only an address on a scrap of paper, an unnamed young man searches for his college sweetie through a village full of crazies, dark woods seething with menace, and haunted mansions hung with wicked mirrors on the walls. Sala&#x2019;s high-class horror sensibility is equal parts sinister and gleeful: a wild cackle of frights steeped in the grand gothic tradition of Edward Gorey. The tale, originally serialized in Fantagraphics&#x2019; Ignatz Series, is drawn in shades of doomful brown and accented by a few striking, full-color chapter breaks. Sala&#x2019;s quavery lines dish out plenty of unsettling images, and he ratchets up the eeriness with stylized, hand-drawn lettering. Though he sacrifices some narrative sense in favor of creepy atmospherics and downright baffling transitions, Sala does a fine job of keeping everything just slightly out of balance and off-kilter. Just take a guess at how happily this ever after turns out to be. --Ian Chipman</p><h2>Formula One Circuits from Above: 28 Legendary Tracks in High-Definition Satellite Photography</h2><p><b>Formula One fans will enjoy exploring the sport in a unique way: using the breathtaking satellite photography of Google Earth! </b><br><br> This revised edition of <i>Formula One Circuits from Above</i> contains entirely new entries on tracks in Baku, Azerbaijan and Sochi, Russia, along with image and text updates to many of the 28 courses.

A middle school reading teacher in Maryland for eighteen years, Wayne tailors his stories to meet the needs of the young people he cares so deeply about. Wayne writes adventures set in imaginative settings because he believes that on a deep level, we all dream of doing something that matters and that we all long for another world.Much of this first book of the Berinfell Prophecies lays the historical groundwork for the series. Seven 13-year-olds in various cities learn that they&#39;re actually elves who were exiled as babies and adopted by humans, who had no idea who they really were. The time has come for them to return home to Allyra. Greg Whalen&#39;s generally relaxed narration presents a strong contrast to his suspenseful delivery of the events that unfold. As the youngsters&#39; journey home begins, led by the Sentinels, the Spider King and his minions actively try to destroy them. Whalen uses a range of accents, some which sound more credible than others. In all, his narration is well paced and engaging.

Reissue.</p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.While this Nero Wolfe mystery might be creaking a bit with old age, the Stout magic still plays well, decades after first publication. A murder mystery wrapped around a puzzle entices Wolfe and the ever steady Archie Goodwin to big pay dirt and even greater fame. The cast of characters is colorful, and the pressure mounts until a truly dastardly event takes place--murder right in Wolfe's office. Veteran narrator Michael Prichard does an outstanding job, especially when Wolfe and Archie work together. Not all of Stout's mysteries work as well as this one, but whether or not you get through it before midnight, a great listening experience is guaranteed.

The part in his hair was exact, and his dark suit was sober but comforting. I am a man you can bring your problems to, that suit said to the paying customer. To the hired help it spoke more curtly: This had better be good, you. There was a red carnation in the lapel, perhaps so that no one on the street would mistake Stuart Ullman for the local undertaker.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As he listened to Ullman speak, Jack admitted to himself that he probably could not have liked any man on that side of the desk -- under the circumstances.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ullman had asked a question he hadn't caught. That was bad; Ullman was the type of man who would file such lapses away in a mental Rolodex for later consideration.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I asked if your wife fully understood what you would be taking on here. And there's your son, of course." He glanced down at the application in front of him. "Daniel. Your wife isn't a bit intimidated by the idea?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Wendy is an extraordinary woman."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"And your son is also extraordinary?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jack smiled, a big wide PR smile. "We like to think so, I suppose. He's quite self-reliant for a five-year-old."</p><p></p><p></p><p>No returning smile from Ullman. He slipped Jack's application back into a file. The file went into a drawer. The desk top was now completely bare except for a blotter, a telephone, a Tensor lamp, and an in/out basket. Both sides of the in/out were empty, too.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ullman stood up and went to the file cabinet in the corner. "Step around the desk, if you will, Mr. Torrance. We'll look at the hotel floor plans."</p><p></p><p></p><p>He brought back five large sheets and set them down on the glossy walnut plain of the desk. Jack stood by his shoulder, very much aware of the scent of Ullman's cologne. <i>All my men wear English Leather or they wear nothing at all</i> came into his mind for no reason at all, and he had to clamp his tongue between his teeth to keep in a bray of laughter. Beyond the wall, faintly, came the sounds of the Overlook Hotel's kitchen, gearing down from lunch.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Top floor," Ullman said briskly. "The attic. Absolutely nothing up there now but bric-a-brac. The Overlook has changed hands several times since World War II and it seems that each successive manager has put everything they don't want up in the attic. I want rattraps and poison bait sowed around in it. Some of the third-floor chambermaids say they have heard rustling noises. I don't believe it, not for a moment, but there mustn't even be that one-in-a-hundred chance that a single rat inhabits the Overlook Hotel."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jack, who suspected that every hotel in the world had a rat or two, held his tongue.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Of course you wouldn't allow your son up in the attic under any circumstances."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"No," Jack said, and flashed the big PR smile again. Humiliating situation. Did this officious little prick actually think he would allow his son to goof around in a rattrap attic full of junk furniture and God knew what else?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ullman whisked away the attic floor plan and put it on the bottom of the pile.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"The Overlook has one hundred and ten guest quarters," he said in a scholarly voice. "Thirty of them, all suites, are here on the third floor. Ten in the west wing (including the Presidential Suite), ten in the center, ten more in the east wing. All of them command magnificent views."</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Could you at least spare the salestalk?</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>But he kept quiet. He needed the job.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ullman put the third floor on the bottom of the pile and they studied the second floor.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Forty rooms," Ullman said, "thirty doubles and ten singles. And on the first floor, twenty of each. Plus three linen closets on each floor, and a storeroom which is at the extreme east end of the hotel on the second floor and the extreme west end on the first. Questions?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jack shook his head. Ullman whisked the second and first floors away.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Now. Lobby level. Here in the center is the registration desk. Behind it are the offices. The lobby runs for eighty feet in either direction from the desk. Over here in the west wing is the Overlook Dining Room and the Colorado Lounge. The banquet and ballroom facility is in the east wing. Questions?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Only about the basement," Jack said. "For the winter caretaker, that's the most important level of all. Where the action is, so to speak."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Watson will show you all that. The basement floor plan is on the boiler room wall." He frowned impressively, perhaps to show that as manager, he did not concern himself with such mundane aspects of the Overlook's operation as the boiler and the plumbing. "Might not be a bad idea to put some traps down there too. Just a minute..."</p><p></p><p></p><p>He scrawled a note on a pad he took from his inner coat pocket (each sheet bore the legend <i>From the Desk of Stuart Ullman</i> in bold black script), tore it off, and dropped it into the out basket. It sat there looking lonesome. The pad disappeared back into Ullman's jacket pocket like the conclusion of a magician's trick. Now you see it, Jacky-boy, now you don't. This guy is a real heavyweight.</p><p></p><p></p><p>They had resumed their original positions, Ullman behind the desk and Jack in front of it, interviewer and interviewee, supplicant and reluctant patron. Ullman folded his neat little hands on the desk blotter and looked directly at Jack, a small, balding man in a banker's suit and a quiet gray tie. The flower in his lapel was balanced off by a small lapel pin on the other side. It read simply staff in small gold letters.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I'll be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Torrance. Albert Shockley is a powerful man with a large interest in the Overlook, which showed a profit this season for the first time in its history. Mr. Shockley also sits on the Board of Directors, but he is not a hotel man and he would be the first to admit this. But he has made his wishes in this caretaking matter quite obvious. He wants you hired. I will do so. But if I had been given a free hand in this matter, I would not have taken you on."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jack's hands were clenched tightly in his lap, working against each other, sweating. <i>Officious little prick, officious little prick, officious --</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>"I don't believe you care much for me, Mr. Torrance. I don't care. Certainly your feelings toward me play no part in my own belief that you are not right for the job. During the season that runs from May fifteenth to September thirtieth, the Overlook employs one hundred and ten people full-time; one for every room in the hotel, you might say. I don't think many of them like me and I suspect that some of them think I'm a bit of a bastard. They would be correct in their judgment of my character. I have to be a bit of a bastard to run this hotel in the manner it deserves."</p><p></p><p></p><p>He looked at Jack for comment, and Jack flashed the PR smile again, large and insultingly toothy.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ullman said: "The Overlook was built in the years 1907 to 1909. The closest town is Sidewinder, forty miles east of here over roads that are closed from sometime in late October or November until sometime in April. A man named Robert Townley Watson built it, the grandfather of our present maintenance man. Vanderbilts have stayed here, and Rockefellers, and Astors, and Du Ponts. Four Presidents have stayed in the Presidential Suite, Wilson, Harding, Roosevelt, and Nixon."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I wouldn't be too proud of Harding and Nixon," Jack murmured.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ullman frowned but went on regardless. "It proved too much for Mr. Watson, and he sold the hotel in 1915. It was sold again in 1922, in 1929, in 1936. It stood vacant until the end of World War II, when it was purchased and completely renovated by Horace Derwent, millionaire inventor, pilot, film producer, and entrepreneur."</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Sexual Anarchy: Gender and Culture at the Fin De Siecle</h2><p>An exploration of the paralells between the ends of the 19th and 20th centuries and their representations in art, literature and film, this book asks whether the approaching millenium signals a beginning or points grimly to an end, and whether the ends of centuries are merely imaginery borderlines in time, or cycles, such as the crises of the &#34;fin de siecle&#34; and the sense of ending so ominously present in the works of contemporary writers and artists. The novelist George Gissing remarked that the 1880s and 1890s were decades of sexual anarchy, when the notions of gender that governed sexual identity and behaviour were being constantly eroded. It was a time when the words &#34;feminism&#34; and &#34;homosexuality&#34; came into use, redefining accepted ideas of masculine and feminine, and a time when the &#34;emancipated woman&#34; was viewed as a threat to family stability. That was nearly 100 years ago, and in this book the author points out the similarity between that time and this time. The sexual abuse of children and the increasing frequency of rape; the censoring of art and the banning of pornography; anti-abortion campaigns and the AIDs epidemic - these late-20th-century crises are, the author suggests, comparable to their &#34;fin de siecle&#34; counterparts. Elaine Showalter is also the author of &#34;A Literature of Their Own: Women Writers from Bronte to Lessing&#34; and &#34;The Female Malady: Women, Madness, and English Culture, 1830 - 1980&#34;.</p><p>Elaine Showalter was born in Cambridge, Mass in 1941 and was educated at Bryn Mawr College and the University of California. From 1967 to 1984 she taught at English and Women&#39;s Studies at Rutger&#39;s University and is now Professor of English at Princeton University.A history of the sexes and the crises, themes, and problems associated with the battle for sexual supremacy and identity, this work draws striking cultural parallels between the end of the 19th century and the end of the 20th century. Showalter explores the history and attitudes toward homosexuality, unmarried men and women, the concepts of masculinity and femininity, sexual fears and fantasies, sexual surgery, and sexual epidemics as represented in psychological, medical, and literary texts, visual art, and film. Fascinating and provocative, this book reflects the realities of history repeating itself and the impact of gender crisis on culture.<br><i>- Jeris Cassel, Rutgers Univ. Libs., New Brunswick, N.J.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville</h2><p>What does it mean to be an American, and what can America be today?<b> </b>To answer these questions, celebrated philosopher and journalist Bernard-Henri L�vy spent a year traveling throughout the country in the footsteps of another great Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, whose Democracy in America remains the most influential book ever written about our country. <br>The result is<b> </b>American Vertigo, a fascinating, wholly fresh look at a country we sometimes only think we know. From Rikers Island to Chicago mega-churches, from Muslim communities in Detroit to an Amish enclave in Iowa, L�vy investigates issues at the heart of our democracy: the special nature of American patriotism, the coexistence of freedom and religion (including the religion of baseball), the prison system, the &#x201c;return of ideology&#x201d; and the health of our political institutions, and much more. He revisits and updates Tocqueville&#x2019;s most important beliefs, such as the dangers posed by &#x201c;the tyranny of the majority,&#x201d; explores what Europe and America have to learn from each other, and interprets what he sees with a novelist&#x2019;s eye and a philosopher&#x2019;s depth. <br>Through powerful interview-based portraits across the spectrum of the American people, from prison guards to clergymen, from Norman Mailer to Barack Obama, from Sharon Stone to Richard Holbrooke, L�vy fills his book with a tapestry of American voices&#x2013;some wise, some shocking. Both the grandeur and the hellish dimensions of American life are unflinchingly explored. And big themes emerge throughout, from the crucial choices America <br>faces today to the underlying reality that, unlike the &#x201c;Old World,&#x201d; America remains the fulfillment of the world&#x2019;s desire to worship, earn, and live as one wishes&#x2013;a place, despite all, where inclusion remains not just an ideal but an actual practice.<br>At a time when Americans are anxious about how the world perceives them and, indeed, keen to make sense of themselves, a brilliant and sympathetic foreign observer has arrived to help us begin a new conversation about the meaning of America.</p><p>Bernard-Henry L�vy is a philosopher, journalist, activist, and filmmaker. He was hailed by Vanity Fair magazine as &#x201c;Superman and prophet: we have no equivalent in the United States.&#x201d; Among his dozens of books are Barbarism with a Human Face and Who Killed Daniel Pearl? His writing has appeared in a wide range of publications throughout Europe and the United States. His films include the documentaries Bosna! and A Day in the Death of Sarajevo. L�vy is co-founder of the antiracist group SOS Racism and has served on diplomatic missions for the French government.chapter I<br><br> First Visions<br><br> (from Newport to Des Moines)<br><br> A People and Its Flag<br><br> It was here, not too far south of Boston, on the East Coast, which still bears the mark of Europe so clearly, that Alexis de Tocqueville came ashore: Newport, Rhode Island. This well-kept Easton&#x2019;s Beach. These yachts. These Palladian mansions and painted wooden houses that remind me of the beach towns of Normandy. A naval museum. An athenaeum library. Bed-and-breakfasts with a picture of the owner displayed instead of a sign. Gorgeous trees. Tennis courts. A Georgian-style synagogue, exhibited as the oldest in the United States: with its well-polished pale wood, its fluted columns, its spotless black rattan chairs, its large candelabra, its plaque engraved with clear-cut letters in memory of Isaac Touro and the six or seven great spiritual leaders who succeeded him, its American flag standing next to the Torah scroll under glass, it seems to me, on the contrary, strangely modern.<br><br> And then, precisely, the flags: a riot of American flags, at crossroads, on building fronts, on car hoods, on pay phones, on the furniture displayed in the windows along Thames Street, on the boats tied to the dock and on the moorings with no boats, on beach umbrellas, on parasols, on bicycle saddlebags&#x2014;everywhere, in every form, flapping in the wind or on stickers, an epidemic of flags that has spread throughout the city. There are also, as it happens, a lot of Japanese flags. A Japanese cultural festival is opening, with exhibitions of prints, sushi samples on the boardwalk, sumo wrestling in the street, barkers enticing passersby to come see these wonders, these monsters: &#x201c;Come on! Look at them&#x2014;all white and powdered! Three hundred pounds! Legs like hams! So fat they can&#x2019;t even walk! They needed three seats in the airplane! Step right up!&#x201d; And, therefore, white flags with a red ball, symbol of the Land of the Rising Sun, hang from the balconies on this street of jewelers near the harbor where I&#x2019;m searching for a restaurant, to have lunch. In the end, though, it&#x2019;s the American flag that dominates. One is struck by the omnipresence of the Star-Spangled Banner, even on the T-shirts of the kids who come to watch the sumo wrestlers as the little crowd cheers them on.<br><br> It&#x2019;s the flag of the American cavalry in westerns. It&#x2019;s the flag of Frank Capra movies. It&#x2019;s the fetish that is there, in the frame, every time the American president appears. It&#x2019;s the beloved flag, almost a living being, the use of which, I understand, is subject not just to rules but to an extremely precise code of flag behavior: don&#x2019;t get it dirty, don&#x2019;t copy it, don&#x2019;t tattoo it onto your body, never let it fall on the ground, never hang it upside down, don&#x2019;t insult it, don&#x2019;t burn it. On the other hand, if it gets too old, if it can no longer be used, if it can&#x2019;t be flown, then you must burn it; yes, instead of throwing it out or bundling it up, better to burn it than abandon it in the trash. It&#x2019;s the flag that was offended by Kid Rock at the Super Bowl, and it&#x2019;s the flag of Michael W. Smith in his song &#x201c;There She Stands,&#x201d; written just after September 11, in which &#x201c;she&#x201d; is none other than &#x201c;it,&#x201d; the flag, the American symbol that was targeted, defiled, attacked, scorned by the barbarians, but is always proudly unfurled.<br><br> It&#x2019;s a little strange, this obsession with the flag. It&#x2019;s incomprehensible for someone who, like me, comes from a country virtually without a flag&#x2014;where the flag has, so to speak, disappeared; where you see it flying only in front of official buildings; and where any nostalgia and concern for it, any evocation of it, is a sign of an attachment to the past that has become almost ridiculous. Is this flag obsession a result of September 11? A response to that trauma whose violence we Europeans persist in underestimating but which, three years later, haunts American minds as much as ever? Should we reread those pages in Tocqueville on the good fortune of being sheltered by geography from violations of the nation&#x2019;s territorial space and come to see in this return to the flag a neurotic abreaction to the astonishment that the violation actually occurred? Or is it something else entirely? An older, more conflicted relationship of America with itself and with its national existence? A difficulty in being a nation, more severe than in the flagless countries of old Europe, that produces this compensatory effect?<br><br> Leafed through the first few pages of One Nation, After All, which the author, the sociologist Alan Wolfe, gave me last night. Maybe the secret lies in this &#x201c;after all.&#x201d; Maybe American patriotism is more complex, more painful, than it seems at first glance, and perhaps its apparent excessiveness comes from that. Or perhaps it has to do, as Tocqueville saw it, rather with a kind of &#x201c;reflective patriotism&#x201d; which, unlike the &#x201c;instinctive love&#x201d; that reigned during the regimes of times past, is forced to exaggerate when it comes to emblems and symbols. To be continued . . .<br><br> Tell Me What Your Prisons Are . . .<br><br> Tocqueville&#x2019;s first intention was, we tend to forget, to investigate the American penal system. He went beyond that, of course. He analyzed the political system and American society in its entirety better than anyone. But as his notes, his journal, his letters to Kergorlay and others, and the very text of Democracy in America attest, it was with this business of prisons that everything began, and that&#x2019;s why I too, after Newport, asked to see the New York prison of Rikers Island, that city within a city on an island that is not shown on every map&#x2014;a place few New Yorkers seem to take much notice of.<br><br> A meeting with Mark J. Cranston, of the New York City Department of Corrections, this Tuesday morning at 5:00 a.m. in Queens, at the entrance to a bridge that doesn&#x2019;t lead anywhere open to the public. Landscape of desolate shoreline in the foggy morning light. Electric barbed-wire fences. High walls. A checkpoint, as at the edge of a war zone, where the prison guards, almost all of them black, greet one another as they come on duty, and&#x2014;heading in the opposite direction, packed into barred buses that look like school buses&#x2014;the prisoners, also mainly black, or Hispanic, who are driven with chains on their feet to courthouses in the Bronx and Queens. A security badge along with my photo. Frisked. On the other side of the East River, in the fog, a white boat like a ghost ship, where, for lack of space, the least dangerous criminals are locked up. And very soon, clinging to New York (La Guardia is so close that, at times, when the wind blows from a certain quarter, the noise from the planes makes you raise your voice or even stop talking), the ten prison buildings that make up this fortress, this enclave cut off from everything, this anti-utopian reservation.<br><br> The common room, dirty gray, where the people arrested during the night are assembled, seated on makeshift benches. A small cell, No. 14, where two prisoners (white&#x2014;is that by chance?) have been isolated. A neater dormitory, with clean sheets, where a sign indicates, as in Manhattan bars, that the zone is &#x201c;smoke-free.&#x201d; A man, weirdly agitated, who, taking me for a health inspector, hurries toward me to complain about the mosquitoes. And before we arrive at the detention center proper, before the row of cells, all identical, like minuscule horse stalls, a labyrinth of corridors sliced with bars and opening onto the series of &#x201c;social&#x201d; areas they persist in showing me: a chapel; a mosque; a volleyball court from which a distant birdsong rises; a library, where everyone is free, they tell me, to consult law manuals; another room, finally, where there are three open boxes of letters, marked grievance, legal aid, and social services. At first sight you&#x2019;d think it is a dilapidated hospital, but one obsessed with hygiene: the enormous black female guard, her belt studded with keys, who is guiding me through this maze explains that the first thing to do when a delinquent arrives is to have him take a shower in order to disinfect him, later on she tells me&#x2014;in the nice booming voice of a guard who has wound up, since there&#x2019;s no other choice, liking these prisoners&#x2014;that the second urgent thing is to run a battery of psychological tests to identify the suicidal temperaments; prisoners call to her as we pass, insult her because they&#x2019;ve been denied the use of the recreation room or the canteen, make farting noises at which she doesn&#x2019;t bat an eye, stop her sometimes to confide a wish to live or die; it&#x2019;s only when you look at them up close, obviously, that things become more complicated.<br><br> This man with shackled feet. This other one, handcuffs on his wrists and gloves over the handcuffs, because just last week he hid eight razor blades in his ass before throwing himself on a guard to cut his throat. These wild-animal glares, hard to endure. These prisoners for whom a secure system of serving hatches had to be invented, because they took advantage of the moment when their scrap of food was slid over to them to bite the guard&#x2019;s hand. The little Hispanic man, hand on his ear, streaming blood, screaming that he should be taken to the infirmary, under the shouts of his black co-detainees&#x2014;the guard tells me he has a &#x201c;Rikers cut,&#x201d; a ritual gash made to the ear or face of an inmate by the big shots of the Latin Kings and the Bloods, the gangs that control the prison. The shouts, the fuck yous, the enraged banging on the metal doors in the maximum-security section....</p><h2>The Fable of the Bees: Or Private Vices, Publick Benefits, Volume One</h2><p><p><i>Mandeville is the wittiest and shrewdest philosopher ever to make a significant impact upon economics. He anticipated Oscar Wilde in choosing his enemies with great care, and within his own century they included David Hume, Adam Smith, and Francis Hutcheson. He could afford even such enemies because his friends and admirers have been legion.</i></p> <p>&#x2014; George J. Stigler, University of Chicago</p> <p>It used to be that everyone read the "notorious" Bernard Mandeville (1670&#x2013;1733). He was a great satirist and came to have a profound impact on economics, ethics, and social philosophy.</p> <p>The <b><i>Fable</i></b> begins with a poem and continues with a number of essays and dialogues. It is all tied together by the startling and original idea that "private vices" (self-interest) lead to "publick benefits" (the development and operation of society). From that simple beginning, Mandeville saw that orderly social structures (such as law, language, the market, and even the growth of knowledge) were a spontaneous growth developing out of individual human actions.</p></p><p>Bernard Mandeville</p><h2>What You Want Is in the Limo: On the Road with Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, and the Who in 1973, the Year the Sixties Died and the Modern Rock Star Was Born</h2><p><b>An epic joyride through three history-making tours in 1973 that defined rock and roll superstardom&#x2014;the money, the access, the excess&#x2014;forevermore.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> The Who&#x2019;s <i>Quadrophenia</i>. Led Zeppelin&#x2019;s <i>Houses of the Holy</i>. Alice Cooper&#x2019;s <i>Billion Dollar Babies</i>. These three unprecedented tours&#x2014;and the albums that inspired them&#x2014;were the most ambitious of these artists&#x2019; careers, and they forever changed the landscape of rock and roll: the economics, the privileges, and the very essence of the concert experience. On these juggernauts, rock gods&#x2014;and their entourages&#x2014;were born, along with unimaginable overindulgence and the legendary flameouts. Tour buses were traded for private jets, arenas replaced theaters, and performances transmogrified into over-the-top, operatic spectacles. As the sixties ended and the seventies began, an altogether more cynical era took hold: peace, love, and understanding gave way to sex, drugs, and rock and roll. <br> &nbsp;<br> But the decade didn&#x2019;t become the seventies, acclaimed journalist Michael Walker writes, until 1973, a historic and mind-bogglingly prolific year for rock and roll that saw the release of countless classic albums, from <i>The</i> <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> to <i>Goat&#x2019;s Head Soup;</i> <i>Goodbye Yellow Brick Road;</i> <i>Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.; </i>and <i>The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle</i>. Aerosmith, Queen, and Lynyrd Skynyrd released their debut albums. The Roxy and CBGB opened their doors. Every major act of the era&#x2014;from Fleetwood Mac to Black Sabbath&#x2014;was on the road that summer, but of them all, Walker writes, it was The Who, Led Zeppelin, and Alice Cooper who emerged as the game changers. <br> &nbsp;<br> Walker revisits each of these three tours in memorable, all-access detail: he goes backstage, onto the jets, and into the limos, where every conceivable wish could be granted. He wedges himself into the sweaty throng of teenage fans (Walker himself was one of them) who suddenly were an economic force to be reckoned with, and he vividly describes how a decade&#x2019;s worth of decadence was squeezed into twelve heart-pounding, backbreaking, and rule-defying months that redefined, for our modern times, the business of superstardom.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>What You Want Is in the Limo</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Required reading . . . 1973 is a turning point in popular music &#x2014; the border between hippie-ethos &#x2019;60s rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll and conspicuous-consumption excess &#x2019;70s rock.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>New York Post</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Loud and boisterous . . .

At age fifty-five, his intensive search for answers to ultimate questions culminated in an awakening that gave him a unique insight into the workings of the spiritual world. He spent the remainder of his life writing about his experiences and how human beings can come to a deeper awareness of the divine. Swedenborg&#39;s ideas have influenced people as diverse as Helen Keller, Johnny Appleseed, William Blake, Henry James, Ralph Waldo Emerson, D.T. Suzuki, Jorge Luis Borges, and Dr. Mehmet Oz. The continuing appeal of his thought undoubtedly lies in his insights into the afterlife, concepts of divine love, and focus on personal and social development.</p><h2>Churchill&#39;s Bestiary: Winston Churchill and the Animal Kingdom</h2><p>Following the pattern of medieval bestiaries, Brendons book illuminates the life and work of Winston Churchill through animals, from the Albatross he invoked in an important parliamentary speech in 1935, to his fondness for Zoos, despite his aversion to captivity.

A powerful saga that sweeps through two hundred years of history, it introduces artists like John James Audubon, bird collectors like William Brewster, and finally a new breed of scientist in Cornell's Arthur A. "Doc" Allen and his young ornithology student, James Tanner, whose quest to save the Ivory-bill culminates in one of the first great conservation showdowns in U.S. history, an early round in what is now a worldwide effort to save species. As hope for the Ivory-bill fades in the United States, the bird is last spotted in Cuba in 1987, and Cuban scientists join in the race to save it.</p><p>All this, plus Mr. Hoose's wonderful story-telling skills, comes together to give us what David Allen Sibley, author of <i>The Sibley Guide to Birds</i> calls "the most thorough and readable account to date of the personalities, fashions, economics, and politics that combined to bring about the demise of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker."</p><p><i>The Race to Save the Lord God Bird</i> is the winner of the 2005 Boston Globe - Horn Book Award for Nonfiction and the 2005 Bank Street - Flora Stieglitz Award.</p></p><p><p>"A groundbreaking book for readers of any age.

Now for the first time in print, London turns that expert X-ray insight on herself.Like the women she&#x2019;s transformed, London has plenty of emotional baggage. At eleven, she suffered from severe psoriasis that left her with permanent physical and mental scars. During college, she became anorexic on a misguided quest for perfection. By the time she joined the staff at Vogue, London&#x2019;s weight had doubled from binge eating.

In addition, she has appeared on numerous TV programs, including <i>Oprah, Wendy Williams,</i> and <i>Access Hollywood</i>. A contributing editor at <i>People</i> magazine, she previously worked at <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Mademoiselle</i>.With much credit to London, editor and co-host of TLC&#x2019;s What Not to Wear, nine women from situations, including young-married, breast-cancer-survivor, and plus-size blogger, are redressed, restyled, and, most important, re-created into new and thoroughly confident personages. Yes, style is definitely not fashion, and, in each case, the transformation is amazing. For example, Ashley, in the midst of an emotional eating disorder, is now garbed in badass style, complete with leather jacket and fitted jeans; and Tania, who defines herself through her family, forsakes black-on-black for color&#x2014;lots of it. Each woman begins with a letter that is often heart wrenching; London follows with an analysis of symptoms, underlying causes, and a perceptive prescription that frequently is couched in very personal terms and peppered with dialogue, color pictures of try-ons, as well as recommendations for closet restocking. Most poignant of all is London&#x2019;s own story, which includes acute psoriasis, anorexia, and, today, her wondrous sense of self.

Each chapter contains columns that explain, by example, how yoga and spirituality can bridge the outer world and inner life.</p><p>SWAMI LALITANANDA is a teacher, author and the director of radha yoga &amp; eatery in Vancouver a space that integrates yoga, vegan food, culture and community. Her latest book, The Inner Life of Asanas and her regular column in ascent magazine offer instruction on how to tap into the symbolic level of the poses to gain insight and expanded awareness. A longtime student of Swami Sivananda Radha, Swami Lalitananda became a sanyasin (renunciate in the yoga tradition) in 1996, and is dedicated to making yoga accessible in everyday life.Here is a fascinating introduction to the practices of Hidden Language Hatha Yoga, a style founded by Swami Sivananda Radha, Swami Lalitananda&#39;s friend and teacher for more then 25 years. (Radha was also the first Western woman to be initiated as a sanyasin, or renunciate, by Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh.) The book, which focuses on developing awareness, not muscles, is a collection of Lalitananda&#39;s columns written for ascent magazine, a Montreal-based yoga and spirituality magazine. Mantra, meditation, and visualization are all used to open the body and mind to self-inquiry; journaling and refleting on a pose&#39;s symbology are encouraged to explore associations and provide new perspectives. For example, after practicing a pose, readers are asked to write about their feelings and observations, to facilitate greater understanding of the connection between world and self. In five chapters outlining the progression of yoga (awareness, choice, action, devotion, and unity), Lalitananda reflects on her own experiences with the Hidden Language technique and takes you through 26 asanas with the secrets they can unlock. --Katherine Rae, yoga JOURNAL</p><h2>Sweetheart (Archie Sheridan &amp; Gretchen Lowell)</h2><p><p>With <i>Heartsick</i>, Chelsea Cain took the crime world by storm, introducing two of the most compelling characters in decades: serial killer Gretchen Lowell and her obsessed pursuer Portland Detective Archie Sheridan.

The trials of raising her teenage children and caring for her sick father have worn her down, but at the request of a friend and in hopes of respite, she's gone to the coastal village of Rodanthe in North Carolina to tend the local inn for the weekend. With a major storm brewing, the time away doesn't look promising...until a guest named Paul Flanner arrives. <br>At 54, Paul is a successful surgeon, but in the previous six months his life has unraveled into something he doesn't recognize. Estranged from his son and recently divorced, he's sold his practice and his home and has journeyed to this isolated town in hopes of closing a painful chapter in his past. Adrienne and Paul come together as the storm brews over Rodanthe, but what begins between them over the weekend will resonate throughout the rest of their lives, intertwining past and future, love and loss.<br> <br></p><p>With over 100 million copies of his books sold, Nicholas Sparks is one of the world's most beloved storytellers. His novels include fifteen #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, and all of his books, including <i>Three Weeks with My Brother</i>, the memoir he wrote with his brother, Micah, have been <i>New York Times</i> and international bestsellers, and were translated into more than fifty languages. Eleven of Nicholas Sparks's novels--<i>The Choice, The Longest Ride, The Best of Me, Safe Haven, The Lucky One, The Last Song, Dear John, Nights in Rodanthe, The Notebook, A Walk to Remember</i>, and <i>Message in a Bottle</i>--have been adapted into major motion pictures.Adrienne Willis's concern for her widowed daughter prompts her to relate a story she thought would live only in her own heart, a story of love and redemption, loss and grief. JoBeth Williams's tender narration captures the introspection and sadness of Adrienne's tale, as well as its passion. Her detached portrayal of Paul and Adrienne's lives before they find each other conveys all the flatness of their existence, despite the many events filling their days. Williams's characterizations, however, particularly that of the women, would be better if they were not infused with Southern accents. While technically accurate, they sound more stereotypical than real. Soft piano interludes elegantly separate chapters and polish the finished work.

The family will be torn apart, and the quest for the hand of Melanie Benson will forever affect the lives of cousins Clay and Gideon Rocklin. Maynard Villers reads this first book in the Appomattox series in a straightforward manner. Some character vocalizations--such as Gideon and Melanie--are subtle; others are more dramatic and less successful: The slave dialects and children are overdone, and attempts at strong Southern accents are unconvincing. His emotional tone, however, is true, and the narrative is well paced. M.A.M. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineThe clipped, staccato narration of Maynard Villers seems inappropriate at times for this version of the first book of Morris's series, especially during the romantic segments. On a prosperous Southern plantation, the Rocklin cousins Clay and Gideon Rocklin fight over the favors of beautiful Melanie Benton. When Melanie decides to marry Gideon, Clay descends into a life of drunkenness that eventually ends in his being banned from the family plantation by his father. Years later, wealthy from his years as a slave trader, Clay returns, only to discover many in his family are not quite ready to forgive his errant behavior. Gideon, meanwhile, has achieved success in the army, and, as war approaches, the cousins realize they may soon be fighting on opposite sides. Morris's family sagas are usually entertaining, and this one is no exception. Clay's transformation from an immature and thoughtless man to a devout Christian is an especially well-written and dramatic story. Despite Villers hurried narration, however, this will prove popular with Morris's many fans.?Melissa Hudak, Centegra Health System, McHenry, IL<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Harriet the Spy</h2><p>The revelation of Harriet&#39;s secret journal, recording the activities of her neighbors and schoolmates, causes chaos.</p><p>Ages 8-12. Thirty-two years before it was made into a movie, <i>Harriet the Spy</i> was a groundbreaking book: its unflinchingly honest portrayal of childhood problems and emotions changed children's literature forever. Happily, it has neither dated nor become obsolete and remains one of the best children's novels ever written. The fascinating story is about an intensely curious and intelligent girl, who literally spies on people and writes about them in her secret notebook, trying to make sense of life's absurdities. When her classmates find her notebook and read her painfully blunt comments about them, Harriet finds herself a lonely outcast. Fitzhugh's writing is astonishingly vivid, real and engaging, and Harriet, by no means a typical, loveable heroine, is one of literature's most unforgettable characters. <i>School Library Journal</i> wrote, "a tour de force... bursts with life." The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books called it "a very, very funny story." And <i>The Chicago Tribune</i> raved, "brilliantly written... a superb portrait of an extraordinary child."Harriet M. Welsch is a spy. In her notebook, she writes down everything she knows about everyone, even her classmates and her best friends. Then Harriet loses track of her notebook, and it ends up in the wrong hands. Before she can stop them, her friends have read the always truthful, sometimes awful things she&#39;s written about each of them. Will Harriet find a way to put her life and her friendships back together?</p><h2>Stolen World: A Tale of Reptiles, Smugglers, and Skulduggery</h2><p><b>Tortoises disappear from a Madagascar reserve and reappear in the Bronx Zoo. A dead iguana floats in a jar, awaiting its unveiling in a Florida court. A viper causes mayhem from Ethiopia to Virginia. In <i>Stolen World</i>, Jennie Erin Smith takes the reader on an unforgettable journey, a dark adventure over five decades and six continents.&nbsp; </b><br>&nbsp;<br>In 1965, Hank Molt, a young cheese salesman from Philadelphia, reinvented himself as a &#x201c;specialist dealer in rare fauna,&#x201d; traveling the world to collect exquisite reptiles for zoos and museums. By the end of the decade that followed, new endangered species laws had turned Molt into a convicted smuggler, and an unrepentant one, who went on to provide many of the same rare reptiles to many of the same institutions, covertly.&nbsp;<br><br>But Molt soon found a rival in Tommy Crutchfield, a Florida carpet salesman with every intention of usurping Molt as the most accomplished reptile smuggler in the country. Like Molt, Crutchfield had modeled himself after an earlier generation of natural-history collectors celebrated for their service to science, an ideal that, for Molt and Crutchfield, eclipsed the realities of the new wildlife-protection laws. Zoo curators, caught between a desire for rare animals and the conservation-minded focus of their institutions, became the smugglers&#x2019; antagonists in court but also their best customers, sometimes simultaneously.&nbsp;<br><br>Crutchfield forged ties with a criminally inclined Malaysian wildlife trader and emerged a millionaire, beloved by some of the finest zoos in the world. Molt, following a string of inventive but disastrous smuggling schemes in New Guinea, was reduced to hanging around Crutchfield&#x2019;s Florida compound, plotting Crutchfield&#x2019;s demise. The fallout from their feud would result in a major federal investigation with tentacles in Germany, Madagascar, Holland, and Malaysia. And yet even after prison, personal ruin, and the depredations of age, Molt and Crutchfield never stopped scheming, never stopped longing for the snake or lizard that would earn each his rightful place in a world that had forgotten them&#x2014;or rather, had never recognized them to begin with.</p><p>JENNIE ERIN SMITH is a freelance science reporter and a frequent reviewer on<br>animals and natural history for the <i>Times Literary Supplement.</i> She is a recipient<br>of the Rona Jaffe Award for women writers, a fellowship at the Fine Arts Work<br>Center in Provincetown, Massachusetts, two first-place awards from the American<br>Association of Sunday and Feature Editors, and the Waldo Proffitt Award for<br>environmental journalism.&#x201c;Vile, venomous and best kept under lock and key - and that's just the people in this gripping book.

Though already a widely acclaimed novelist, the author of such modern classics as <em>The Orchard Keeper</em> and <em>Child of God</em>, McCarthy had never before written a screenplay. Using a few photographs in the footnotes to a 1928 biography of a famous pre&#x2013;Civil War industrialist as inspiration, McCarthy and Pearce roamed the mill towns of the South researching their subject. A year later McCarthy finished <em>The Gardener's Son</em>, a taut, riveting drama of impotence, rage, and violence spanning two generations of mill owners and workers, fathers and sons, during the rise and fall of one of America's most bizarre utopian industrial experiments. Produced as a two-hour film and broadcast on PBS in 1976, <em>The Gardener's Son</em> received two Emmy Award nominations and was shown at the Berlin and Edinburgh Film Festivals.</p><p>Set in Graniteville, South Carolina, <em>The Gardener's Son</em> is the tale of two families: the wealthy Greggs, who own and operate the local cotton mill, and the McEvoys, a family of mill workers beset by misfortune. The action opens as Robert McEvoy, a young mill worker, is having his leg amputated after an accident rumored to have been caused by James Gregg, the son of the mill's founder. Crippled and consumed by bitterness, McEvoy deserts both his job and his family.</p><p>Returning two years later at the news of his mother's terminal illness, McEvoy arrives only to confront the grave diggers preparing her final resting place. His father, the mill's gardener, is now working on the factory line, the gardens forgotten. These proceedings stoke the slow-burning rage McEvoy carries within him, a fury that will ultimately consume both families.</p><p>Cormac McCarthy is the author of numerous novels, including <em>Blood Meridian</em>, <em>No Country for Old Men</em>, and <em>The Road</em>. He has won the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize. His plays include <em>The Stonemason</em> and <em>The Sunset Limited</em>, which was originally performed by Steppenwolf Theatre Company. His screenplay <em>The Counselor</em> was made into a film directed by Ridley Scott and released in 2013.</p></p><h2>Cook&#39;s Illustrated 2008 (Cook&#39;s Illustrated Annuals)</h2><p>This fun food filled book has absolutley nothing wrong with it.

Anyone interested in comparative religion will find in this booklet many surprises that challenge what many once believed to be absolute truths. This work by Dr. Hasan M. Baagil reflects his meticulous and painstaking effort to present his findings clearly, concisely, and thoroughly. As a result of his study of Christianity and the Bible over a four-year period, Dr. Baagil, a dedicated Muslim, learned that Christians differ in their basic beliefs (i.e., the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus, etc.), that Church doctrine contradicts the Bible numerous times, and that the Bible even contradicts itself! His conversations with Christian clergy and laity during this period of study have provided the impetus for the Muslim-Christian Dialogue. The reader will be surprised to learn that, in the Bible, Jesus (pbuh) never claimed to be God; that he did not die on the cross; that the miracles performed by him were also performed by many other prophets and even by disbelievers; and that Jesus himself prophesied the advent of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon both of them. All of this plus much more is detailed from clear and concise passages of the Bible. The question that obviously must be raised after witnessing such clear contradictions is: Is the Bible God&#39;s Word? The effort here by Dr. Baagil is not intended to deride Christian people, and certainly not to mock Jesus and his teachings, as Allah forbids such activities. The intent is only to point out that false charges, misrepresentations, and outright lies against Allah and His prophets are in themselves both deriding and mocking in nature.</p><p></p><h2>Darwin&#39;s Forgotten Defenders: The Encounter Between Evangelical Theology and Evolutionary Thought</h2><p>Argues that the creationist movement is not rooted in evangelicalism, but in twentieth century fundamentalism, and analyzes the initial reception of Darwin&#39;s theory</p><p>Tracing the Christian response to evolution from the mid-19th century to the present, Livingstone finds accommodation to have been more common than confrontation. Nineteenth-century theologians concentrated upon reconciling evolutionary thought with the existence of a Divine plan for the universe. It was only with the rise of Fundamentalism, which saw evolutionary theory as an attack upon the authority of scripture and as yet another of the modern forces demolishing society's old values, that a split between religion and science developed. Hence, Livingstone concludes, this split is not necessary. While not as comprehensive as James R. Moore's The Post-Darwinian Controveries ( LJ 7/79), this is an excellent work. D.

In a book that asks, "Is there an ethics of memory?" Avishai Margalit addresses a separate, perhaps more pressing, set of concerns. </p><p>The idea he pursues is that the past, connecting people to each other, makes possible the kinds of "thick" relations we can call truly ethical. Thick relations, he argues, are those that we have with family and friends, lovers and neighbors, our tribe and our nation--and they are all dependent on shared memories. But we also have "thin" relations with total strangers, people with whom we have nothing in common except our common humanity. A central idea of the ethics of memory is that when radical evil attacks our shared humanity, we ought as human beings to remember the victims. </p><p>Margalit's work offers a philosophy for our time, when, in the wake of overwhelming atrocities, memory can seem more crippling than liberating, a force more for revenge than for reconciliation. Morally powerful, deeply learned, and elegantly written, <i>The Ethics of Memory</i> draws on the resources of millennia of Western philosophy and religion to provide us with healing ideas that will engage all of us who care about the nature of our relations to others.</p></p><p>Avishai Margalit is Schulman Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a former George F. Kennan Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.&#x201c;To say that it makes a substantial contribution to scholarship on an important topic would be an understatement. There is nothing like it in literature. It is morally powerful, deeply learned, closely argued, and elegantly and engagingly written. Margalit has an unparalleled ability to write clearly and forcefully about subjects that concern almost everyone, yet about which almost no one can say anything without sounding either banal or sentimental. He combines a remarkable sense of literary and cultural nuance with an analytic philosopher's eye for conceptual clarity and fine distinctions.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Arthur Ripstein, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto</b><br><br>&#x201c;This volume is novel in orientation, rich in suggestions and full of arresting lines that stimulate reflection and thought. The main unifying theme, as the title signals, is the treatment of memory, individual and collective, as something responsive to ethical evaluation. Many subsidiary themes are woven in and around this central motif, making for a rich, stimulating text.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Philip Pettit, Professor of Social and Political Theory at the Australian National University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Margalit maintains that we have ethical obligations to remember particular people and, more controversially, that a community can have, and ought to have, collective memories...This illuminating study is highly recommended.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Gordon</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In an analysis that limns sophisticated distinctions with rare clarity, philosopher Margalit explores the way we rely on memory to give meaning and substance to the "thick" ethical relationships of family and friendship...A timely challenge to assess the meaning of what we individually and collectively remember--and forget.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bryce Christensen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Discussing memory's relation to emotions, morality, ethics and forgiveness, Margalit reads the Bible, writers (such as Wordsworth, Edward Albee and E.

Margalit worries the issue from all sides before giving a qualified yes. He doesn't think that memory obligations are inevitable. If you aren't caught up in what he calls "thick" relations, family relations or relations of love or friendship or community, then you may have none at all. But if you are involved in such relations you do have obligations of memory, individual and communal...A lovely and often brilliant book. Margalit is, as he says, an illustrator rather than an explicator.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Galen Strawson</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] thought-provoking book...For Margalit...the paradigm is Jewish memories of the Holocaust, not Muslim memories of humiliation. Still, his sensitive meditations show how these two strains of hurt might be overcome. In a marvelous chapter called "Forgiving and Forgetting," Margalit asks whether we have a duty to forgive those who have wronged us. His answer is elegant...Margalit is an astonishingly humane thinker. His philosophy is always tied to making sense of us humans in all our complexity. And yet he is committed to making sense of us in ways that will make us better.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jonathan Lear</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Avishai Margalit's book is a wonderfully effective antidote to both the marketing of memory and the "discourse" of memory, a gift to all of us who are engaged by the contemporary arguments and who are radically unhappy about them...[Margalit] is a public philosopher, and one of the uses of this book is to display the resources of a good philosophical mind: the analytical skills, the grasp of the relevant example, the patience in argument, the capacity for indirection. It isn't often that these resources are on display in such an accessible book, dealing with a topic so central to its non-professional readers.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Walzer</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Margalit...explores questions that affect human behavior and relationships in an unusually sensitive way.

Easy to use and fun to explore, this 1,400-page tome is the most complete guide ever published on the artists and recordings that really rock. Compiled by dozens of music critics, it reviews and rates more than 14,000 great albums by over 2,200 artists and groups in more than 400 styles both mainstream and alternative including bootlegs, import-only releases, important out-of-print recordings, and lesser-known cult artists. A brief profile details each performer&#39;s career, while insightful reviews of top recordings help define the musician&#39;s artistic development and impact on rock. Expanded biographies spotlight major figures, along with complete album discographies. Also features educational essays and &#34;music maps&#34; that chart the evolution of rock&#39;s diverse subgenres at a glance.</p><p>Vladimir Bogdanov is president of All Media Guide (AMG); Chris Woodstra is AMG editor-in-chief; Stephen Thomas Erlewine is an AMG senior editor.As accurate and obsessively detailed as www.allmusic.com is, its print cousins can seem somewhat redundant. This well-established entry, now in its third edition, offers biographical and listener's advisory information on artists and recordings that All Music Guide (AMG) editors Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine have deemed rock an all-encompassing term that includes pop, soul, R&amp;B, rap, and easy listening. Since the last edition (1997), about 3000 album reviews and 400 artist profiles have been added. That makes for a total of 2200 alphabetically arranged artist entries and 14,000 reviews (rated on a scale of one to five stars), most of which are signed. While the contributors cover a remarkable range of new artists from Aaliyah to Weezer, they often give short shrift to those who recorded prior to the 1980s; sometimes, whole bodies of work are ignored in favor of "best of" compilations. Refreshingly, most reviews are free of rock elitism, so useful guidance is given for styles often reviled by critics (e.g., heavy metal). The closing section offers a series of introductory essays on various rock styles, some obvious ("British Invasion") and others obscure ("Jangle Pop"). Also included are dozens of "music maps," flow charts that illustrate the development of each style. The AMG provides more detail and analysis of an artist's career than the MusicHound, Rough Guide, and Rolling Stone books, so having circulating copies on hand may be most appropriate.

Journey with Zargon and Mustafa though the Persian and Judea deserts in search of the heavenly King, born in Bethlehem. Find out how some gifts can change your life forever. ABOUT The Servant King is created as part of a full-scale musical theatre production called The Heart of Christmas. In it, a little girl discovers the book about Zargon, a prince of Persia, and his quest to find the newborn King in Bethlehem. The musical was created to remind families of the true heart behind the Christmas season and that Yeshua - Jesus, is the greatest gift of all. The story of Zargon was inspired by Henry van Dyke, Jr.&#39;s treasured tale of the Fourth Wiseman, which is one of our favourite Christmas stories of all time. But we wanted to tell the story from the perspective of the servant, Mustafa. The idea that this royal character, a prince of Persia, is using all his intellect and resources to discover the mysteries of ancient prophecies, and yet it is the simple servant who gets the revelation first, that Yeshua was indeed a different type of King, who came not to be served, but to serve. There are many fictional elements to this tale. There are characters we have created in order to tell the story in a fun and engaging way, and hopefully giving you, the reader, another perspective on a familiar tale. But the fictitious characters interact with real people from history who lived at that time, in that place, and their true stories are written in another book. We encourage you to find these stories for yourself and read about Yeshua, Zacchaeus, Maria of Magdala, Simeon and the others in the Bible.</p><p></p><h2>The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times.</h2><p><p>Griffins, Centaurs, Cyclopes, and Giants--these fabulous creatures of classical mythology continue to live in the modern imagination through the vivid accounts that have come down to us from the ancient Greeks and Romans. But what if these beings were more than merely fictions? What if monstrous creatures once roamed the earth in the very places where their legends first arose? This is the arresting and original thesis that Adrienne Mayor explores in <i>The First Fossil Hunters</i>. Through careful research and meticulous documentation, she convincingly shows that many of the giants and monsters of myth did have a basis in fact--in the enormous bones of long-extinct species that were once abundant in the lands of the Greeks and Romans.</p><br><p>As Mayor shows, the Greeks and Romans were well aware that a different breed of creatures once inhabited their lands. They frequently encountered the fossilized bones of these primeval beings, and they developed sophisticated concepts to explain the fossil evidence, concepts that were expressed in mythological stories. The legend of the gold-guarding griffin, for example, sprang from tales first told by Scythian gold-miners, who, passing through the Gobi Desert at the foot of the Altai Mountains, encountered the skeletons of Protoceratops and other dinosaurs that littered the ground.</p><br><p>Like their modern counterparts, the ancient fossil hunters collected and measured impressive petrified remains and displayed them in temples and museums; they attempted to reconstruct the appearance of these prehistoric creatures and to explain their extinction. Long thought to be fantasy, the remarkably detailed and perceptive Greek and Roman accounts of giant bone finds were actually based on solid paleontological facts. By reading these neglected narratives for the first time in the light of modern scientific discoveries, Adrienne Mayor illuminates a lost world of ancient paleontology. As Peter Dodson writes in his Foreword, "Paleontologists, classicists, and historians as well as natural history buffs will read this book with the greatest of delight--surprises abound."</p></p><p>Since fossils have presumably existed for millions of years, why don't we see much paleontological thought from ancient writers? Classics scholar Adrienne Mayor suggests that we can, in fact, learn much about the Greek and Roman attitudes toward fossils if we turn to a surprising source of data and theory: their myths. In <i>The First Fossil Hunters</i>, she explores likely connections between the rich fossil beds around the Mediterranean and tales of griffins and giants originating in the classical world. Striking similarities exist between the <i>Protoceratops</i> skeletons of the Gobi Desert and the legends of the gold-hoarding griffin told by nomadic people of the region, and the fossilized remains of giant Miocene mammals could be taken for the heroes and monsters of earlier times. Mayor makes her case well, but, as with all interpretive science, the arguments are inconclusive. Still, her novel reading of ancient myth--and her critique of the modern scientific mythology that seeks to explain the lack of classical paleontological thinking--is compelling and thought-provoking.<p> The final chapter of <i>The First Fossil Hunters</i> is an engrossing and occasionally quite funny look at "Paleontological Fictions" dating back several thousand years; the false tritons and centaurs give P.T. Barnum and his successors a much longer genealogy than previously thought. Whether or not you accept Mayor's analysis of Greek and Roman thinking, <i>The First Fossil Hunters</i> should open your eyes to new possibilities about our distant past. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p>"In this wonderful book, Adrienne Mayor successfully convinces us that some of our most treasured mythical creatures really were based on the skeletons of extinct animals. It is the best account ever concerning the real meaning of mythical creatures. And Mayor has succeeded in setting the history of paleontology on its ear: the art of skeletal restoration was not invented in the western world."<b>--Jack Horner, Museum of the Rockies, author of<i>Dinosaur Lives</i></b></p><p>"Adrienne Mayor's sometimes provocative and always fascinating blend of history, mythology, and science offers a uniquely enriched dimension to the quest for fossils."<b>--Michael Novacek, American Museum of Natural History</b></p><p>"The Greeks were not the only peoples of antiquity to exploit the past in the interests of devising myth and history, but they were among the most ingenious about it, and recorded their views. Adrienne Mayor has uncovered a barely noticed source for many of the myths of the Old World, and for the first time has assembled in an orderly way the evidence for early man's discovery of and explanations for fossil remains. This is a skillful blend of science, history and imagination which adds a chapter to the history of man's ingenuity, from Central Asia to Greece, to Egypt. Many texts, sites, and pictures will never seem quite the same again, after this very thorough and very lively scholarly excursion into a disregarded source of myth-making."<b>--John Boardman, Oxford University</b></p><p>"A brilliant book, full of new insights into the myths and past of the ancient Greeks. Earthshakingly important."<b>--Robin Lane Fox, author of<i>Alexander the Great</i></b></p><p>"An enthralling book. . . . A fascinating account of ancient Greek responses to fossils of extinct mammal species."<b>--David Sedley, author of<i>Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity</i></b></p><p>"Mayor catches one's attention with her first sentence and doesn't let go until the end . . . In addition to being lively and intelligent, the writing is honest and persuasive. Bringing together classics, archaeology, and paleontology in an original synthesis, Mayor exemplifies in her own research her plea that these fields should profitably confer with one another much more than they do."<b>--William Hansen, Indiana University, Bloomington</b></p></p><h2>Egon Schiele, 1890-1918: Desire and Decay</h2><p>&#34;&#34;Hindering the artist is a crime,&#34;&#34; wrote Egon Schiele in 1912. At the time he was in prison for disseminating immoral drawings. Throughout his work the note of defiance, provocation, and rebellion was sounded. Schiele&#39;s favorite subjects were female nudes and self-portraits, and he worked at his art with furious commitment, though it was not until shortly before his early death that he began to win real recognition. Today, with Oskar Kokoschka, he is seen as the most important of the Austrian artists who came after Klimt.

Through his extensive interviews with creative geniuses of our day, as well as historical records and his own life experience, acclaimed author Pico Iyer paints a picture of why so many have found such richness in stillness and how - from Marcel Proust to Blaise Pascal to Phillipe Starck - they&#39;ve gathered such rare and exhilarating fruits there.</p><p>Pico Iyer is a British born essayist and novelist with an entirely singular sensibility. His various books are linked by his interest in cultural crossroads and the values that transcend boundaries. He has established himself as major presence in culture life of Japan, where he is based, and in the United States, (where he lives during part of the year) Britain (where he was educated), and India where his family traces its roots. An Oxford graduate, he taught at Harvard and is one of few writers whose work, like his interests, transcend cultures."This book isn't a meditation guide or a New-Age tract but rather a celebration of the age-old practice of sitting with no goal in mind and no destination in sight.... Rather than reading it quickly and filing it, readers will likely slow down to meet its pace and might continue carrying it around as a reminder."

Iyer&#x2019;s argument is an engaging amalgam of memoir, reportage, and literary essay . . . Iyer uses a fluid blend of argument and anecdote to make a persuasive and eloquent case that contemplating internal landscapes can be just as rich an experience as traveling through external ones. The fact that he has traveled to some of the world&#x2019;s most obscure corners only strengthens his credibility as a defender of stillness.&#x201d; (<i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A heartfelt manifesto to the benefits of ditching the cellphone and snipping up the frequent flier card, The Art of Stillness is anything but a self-help book or how-to guide for achieving inner peace.&#x201d; (<i>Associated Press</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In lesser hands this tiny volume might be a throwaway of glib, &#x201c;new age&#x201d; comfort-speak, but like Henry David Thoreau&#x2019;s equally brief classic on another seemingly mundane exercise &#x2014; walking &#x2014; Iyer&#x2019;s thoughtful nature leads him to peel back layer upon layer, nodding toward the infinite.... Plunging effortlessly beneath platitudes, this wafer-thin volume reminds us of what might just be the greatest paradox of travel &#x2014; after all our road running, after all our flights of fancy to the farthest corners of the globe, after all our touring, our seeking and questing, perhaps, just perhaps, fellow travelers, there really is no place like home.&#x201d; (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[A] beautiful little book. . . fills an important niche. . .

No matter where nature has placed him--the club rooms of Brooklyn, the Mafia dives of New York's Lower East Side, the wilds of Alaska, or the hills of Hollywood--he has found a way to put on a show and sell tickets at the door. "All life was a theater and I wanted to put it up on a stage," he writes. "I wanted to set the world under a marquee that read: 'Jerry Weintraub Presents.'"<br><br>In WHEN I STOP TALKING, YOU'LL KNOW I'M DEAD, we follow Weintraub from his first great success at age twenty-six with Elvis Presley, whom he took on the road with the help of Colonel Tom Parker; to the immortal days with Sinatra and Rat Pack glory; to his crowning hits as a movie producer, starting with Robert Altman and <em>Nashville</em>, continuing with <em>Oh, God!</em>, <em>The Karate Kid</em> movies, and <em>Diner</em>, among others, and summiting with Steven Soderbergh and <em>Ocean's Eleven</em>, <em>Twelve</em>, and <em>Thirteen</em>.<br><br>Along the way, we'll watch as Jerry moves from the poker tables of Palm Springs (the games went on for days), to the power rooms of Hollywood, to the halls of the White House, to Red Square in Moscow and the Great Palace in Beijing-all the while counseling potentates, poets, and kings, with clients and confidants like George Clooney, Bruce Willis, George H. W. Bush, Armand Hammer, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, John Denver, Bobby Fischer . . .well, the list goes on forever.<br><br>And of course, the story is not yet over . . .as the old-timers say, "The best is yet to come."<br><br>As Weintraub says, "When I stop talking, you'll know I'm dead."<br><br>With wit, wisdom, and the cool confidence that has colored his remarkable career, Jerry chronicles a quintessentially American journey, one marked by luck, love, and improvisation. The stories he tells and the lessons we learn are essential, not just for those who love movies and music, but for businessmen, entrepreneurs, artists . . . everyone.</p><p><strong>Jerry Weintraub</strong> has spent more than five decades in show business, in the process earning a reputation as one of the savviest negotiators, smartest producers, and shrewdest film investors of our time. He has been praised and honored for his philanthropic work and, <strong>as</strong> UNICEF's Man of the Year, was presented the organization's Danny Kaye Humanitarian Award.<br><br><strong>Rich Cohen</strong>, a contributing editor at <em>Vanity Fair </em>and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, is the author of five books, including the bestsellers <em>Tough Jews</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>, and <em>Israel Is Real</em>. He lives in Connecticut with his wife, his dog, and many masculine children. <br>With an emphatic, if somewhat disconcerting, Bronx accent, Jerry Weintraub, renowned entertainment manager, producer, impresario, and storyteller, hopscotches through the memorable moments of his life--from the late 1940s though today. His engaging all-American slant on his success--the result of singularly focused determination and a healthy dose of incredible luck--proposes several business and life lessons. Weintraub&#39;s narration, with few exceptions, is somewhat flat, but, nonetheless, the listener enjoys hearing about his fascinating relationships and international adventures with VIPs and celebrities, among them George H.W. Bush, Armand Hammer, George Clooney, and Brad Pitt. The author exhibits revealing candor in discussing his personal life. An interview at the end of the production provides insights into the art of audiobook narration.

His photographs are frequently featured in <i>National Wildlife, Outdoor Photographer, Natural History, Sierra,</i> and <i>Audubon</i> magazines, as well as in calendars, books, and advertisements. He lives in Colorado Springs.There's more than one way to shoot a frog, as Shaw demonstrates in this splendid book, a thorough course in practical field techniques for closeup photography using a 35mm single-lens reflex camera. Although hobbyists who want to capture the flowers in their garden can glean ideas for composition or the best time of day to photograph, this detailed work is intended primarily for the serious amateur or professional. Success in closeup photography, Shaw maintains, depends on control, and he advocates meticulous experimenting and testing of equipment and supplies before one attempts to photograph in the quickly changing, unpredictable conditions of the field. Shaw (The Nature Photographer's Complete Guide to Professional Field Techniques) is an excellent teacher, establishing a common vocabulary with the reader, presenting lavishly illustrated new material that builds on previous knowledge, repeating important concepts and techniques for emphasis. He believes that technical competence frees the photographer to concentrate on esthetics, and his inspiring pictures are beautiful artworkfields of flowers that evoke impressionist paintings, delicate dogwood blossoms reminiscent of Oriental designs, rare glimpses of snowflakes or raindrops on a yew needle.

Wagner. He offers readers&nbsp;a candid and deeply personal look at his life and career, from his rise to stardom among legends like Cary Grant and Barbara Stanwyck to his troubled marriage, divorce, and remarriage to starlet Natalie Wood. With color photographs and never-before-told stories, this is a quintessentially American, remarkably candid story of one of the great sons of Hollywood.</p></p><p><blockquote><p>In this moving memoir, Robert J. Wagner opens his heart to share the romances, the drama, and the humor of an incredible life</p></blockquote><p>He grew up in Bel Air next door to a golf course that changed his life. As a young boy, he saw a foursome playing one morning featuring none other than Fred Astaire, Clark Gable, Randolph Scott, and Cary Grant. Seeing these giants of the silver screen awed him and fueled his dreams of becoming a movie star. Battling a revolving door of boarding schools and a father who wanted him to forget Hollywood and join the family business, sixteen-year-old Wagner started like any na�ve kid would&#x2014;walking along Sunset Boulevard, hoping that a producer or director would notice him.</p><p>Under the mentorship of stars like Spencer Tracy, he would become a salaried actor in Hollywood's studio system among other hot actors of the moment such as his friends Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis. Working with studio mogul Darryl Zanuck, Wagner began to appear in a number of films alongside the most beautiful starlets&#x2014;but his first love was Barbara Stanwyck, an actress twice his age. As his career blossomed, and after he separated from Stanwyck, he met the woman who would change his life forever, Natalie Wood. They fell instantly and deeply in love and stayed together until the stress of their careers&#x2014;hers marching upward, his inexplicably deflating&#x2014;drove them to divorce.</p><p>Trying to forget the pain, he made more movies and spent his time in Europe with the likes of Steve McQueen, Sophia Loren, Peter Sellers, Laurence Olivier, David Niven, Liz Taylor, and Joan Collins. He would meet and marry the beautiful former model and actress Marion Marshall. Together they had a daughter and made their way back to America, where he found himself at the beginning of a new era in Hollywood&#x2014;the blossoming of television. Lew Wasserman and later Aaron Spelling would work with Wagner as he produced and starred in some of the most successful programs in history. </p><p>Despite his newfound success, his marriage to Marion fell apart. He looked no further than Natalie Wood, for whom he still pined. To the world's surprise, they fell in love all over again, this time more deeply and with maturity. As she settled into a domestic life, raising their own daughter, Courtney, as well as their children from previous marriages, Wagner became the sole provider, reaping the riches of television success. Their life together was cut tragically short, though, when Wood died after falling from their yacht.</p><p>For the first time, Wagner writes about that tremendously painful time. After a serious bout with depression, he finally resurfaced and eventually married Jill St. John, who helped keep his family and his fractured heart together. </p><p>With color photographs and never-before-told stories, this is a quintessentially American story of one of the great sons of Hollywood. </p><p>Robert J. Wagner has been active in Hollywood for more than five decades and has starred in such films as <em>A Kiss Before Dying</em>, <em>The Longest Day</em>, <em>The Pink Panther</em>, and, most recently, the Austin Powers movies. On television, Wagner also starred in three long-running series, <em>It Takes a Thief</em> (with Fred Astaire), <em>Switch</em> (with Eddie Albert and Sharon Gless), and <em>Hart to Hart</em> (with Stefanie Powers). He is currently featured on <em>Two and a Half Men</em>.

We see them under normal circumstances, and also reexamined at the eleventh hour of illness. Together they represent a remarkable cross-section of contemporary Russian characters and attitudes. The experiences of the central character, Oleg Kostoglotov, closely reflect the author's own: Solzhenitsyn himself became a patient in a cancer ward in the mid-1950s, on his release from a labor camp, and later recovered. Translated by Nicholas Bethell and David Burg.</p></p><p>One of the great allegorical masterpieces of world literature, <b>Cancer Ward</b> is both a deeply compassionate study of people facing terminal illness and a brilliant dissection of the ?cancerous? Soviet police state.<p><b>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</b>, winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature, was born in 1918. In February 1945, while he was captain of a reconnaissance battery of the Soviet Army, he was arrested and sentenced to an eight-year term in a labor camp and permanent internal exile, which was cut short by Khrushchev's reforms, allowing him to return from Kazakhstan to Central Russia in 1956. Although permitted to publish <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> in 1962--which remained his only full-length work to have appeared in his homeland until 1990--Solzhenitsyn was by 1969 expelled from the Writers' Union. The publication in the West of his other novels and, in particular, of <i>The Gulag Archipelago,</i> brought retaliation from the authorities. In 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested, stripped of his Soviet citizenship, and forcibly flown to Frankfurt. Solzhenitsyn and his wife and children moved to the United States in 1976. In September 1991, the Soviet government dismissed treason charges against him; Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia in 1994. He died in Moscow in 2008.</p></p><h2>Pinnell and Talifson: Last of the Great Brown Bear Men</h2><p>Story of old time bear hunters</p><p></p><h2>The Story of Modern Skiing</h2><p>This is the definitive history of the sport that has exhilarated and infatuated about 30 million Americans and Canadians over the course of the last fifty years. Consummate insider John Fry chronicles the rise of a ski culture and every aspect of the sport's development, including the emergence of the mega-resort and advances in equipment, technique, instruction, and competition. <br><br>The Story of Modern Skiing is laced with revelations from the author's personal relationships with skiing greats such as triple Olympic gold medalists Toni Sailer and Jean-Claude Killy, double gold medalist and environmental champion Andrea Mead Lawrence, first women's World Cup winner Nancy Greene, World Alpine champion Billy Kidd, Sarajevo gold and silver medalists Phil and Steve Mahre, and industry pioneers such as Vail founder Pete Seibert, metal ski designer Howard Head, and plastic boot inventor Bob Lange. Fry writes authoritatively of alpine skiing in North America and Europe, of Nordic skiing, and of newer variations in the sport: freestyle skiing, snowboarding, and extreme skiing. He looks closely at skiing's relationship to the environment, its portrayal in the media, and its response to social and economic change. <br><br>Maps locating major resorts, records of ski champions, and a timeline, bibliography, glossary, and index of names and places make this the definitive work on modern skiing. Skiers of all ages and abilities will revel in this lively tale of their sport's heritage.</p><p>JOHN FRY is the former editor-in-chief of SKI, America&#39;s oldest ski magazine, and founding editor of the award-winning New York Times magazine Snow Country. His contributions to skiing include direct roles in launching the NASTAR (National Standard Ski Race) program, The Nations Cup of alpine ski racing, and the Graduated Length Method of teaching. Fry is a member of the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame and has received the International Skiing History Association&#39;s Lifetime Achievement Award. He has skied since childhood in North America and around the world."Fry notes that the direct work of his book consumed four years. The greater truth is that it is the result of more personal research spanning a lifetime, a degree of comprehension that comes only from having been there."--Skiing Heritage<br><br>"It's impressive how much Fry actually does pack into a volume that would fit in a skier's backpack along with a couple of sandwiches. Modern Skiing is full of helpful timelines, appendices and glossaries, along with ski trivia." --Seven Days, Burlington, VT<br><br>"John Fry . . . has written a thorough and entertaining history of the sport's growth.

But the insurgency faltered. To revive it, King made a sacrificial act on Good Friday, April 12, 1963: he was arrested. Alone in his cell, reading a newspaper, he found a statement from eight "moderate" clergymen who branded the protests extremist and "untimely." </p><p>King drafted a furious rebuttal that emerged as the "Letter from Birmingham Jail"-a work that would take its place among the masterpieces of American moral argument alongside those of Thoreau and Lincoln. His insistence on the urgency of "Freedom Now" would inspire not just the marchers of Birmingham and Selma, but peaceful insurgents from Tiananmen to Tahrir Squares. </p><p>Scholar Jonathan Rieder delves deeper than anyone before into the Letter-illuminating both its timeless message and its crucial position in the history of civil rights. Rieder has interviewed King's surviving colleagues, and located rare audiotapes of King speaking in the mass meetings of 1963. <i>Gospel of Freedom</i> gives us a startling perspective on the Letter and the man who wrote it: an angry prophet who chastised American whites, found solace in the faith and resilience of the slaves, and knew that moral appeal without struggle never brings justice.</p></p><p><b>Jonathan Rieder</b> is professor of sociology at Barnard College, Columbia University. He is the author of <i>The Word of the Lord Is Upon Me: The Righteous Performance of Martin Luther King, Jr</i>. and <i>Canarsie: The Jews and Italians of Brooklyn Against Liberalism</i>. He has been a regular commentator on TV and radio, a contributor to the<i> New York Times Book Review</i>, and a contributing editor for the<i> New Republic</i>.<p>&#x201c;Rieder offers a sparkling reconsideration of the letter.... Rieder's trenchant comments approach the letter on historical and literary grounds but also as a way to better understand the often elusive King....

What distinguishes this work is the author's close reading of King's letter and his explorations of its origins and aftermath... By analyzing the 'Letter' as both literature and moral imperative, Rieder adds to his subject's considerable legacy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Rieder's middle chapters include richly detailed interpretations revealing King's brilliance as an advocate for equality. He portrays King the diplomat as a patient teacher who later transformed into a raging Old Testament prophet who forcefully condemned racism. VERDICT This book's significance lies in its interpretation of the letter, which was itself published later in 1963, and its insights into the often inscrutable King.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Karl Helicher, Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Rieder has brought together a great deal of research, studying archived recordings of King's talks and sermons as well as digging deep into the events of the campaign. Especially apt is the attention he has given to Birmingham's local civil-rights leaders--the great Fred Shuttlesworth, for instance, a man whom Klansmen repeatedly tried to assassinate and whom Bull Connor's fire hoses would gravely injure in May.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Rieder assumes a familiarity with the text as he analyzes the letter and displays a remarkably deep knowledge of King's larger body of work, with cross-references and connections to other sermons and writings. Perhaps the most powerful and instructive of these comparisons is in relation to the &#x2018;I Have a Dream' speech, given a few months after the letter was penned.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;A brilliant new reading of &#x2018;Letter from Birmingham Jail.' Rieder rescues a document too often encased in abstraction, insisting we read it in its searing moment: amidst the violence, hope, and courage of the struggle for racial justice in which it was born. Gospel of Freedom is an indispensable guide to one of the most important documents of the twentieth century.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daniel T. Rodgers, the Lea Professor of History, Princeton University, author of Age of Fracture</i></p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Letter from Birmingham Jail' has been long overshadowed by Martin Luther King's &#x2018;I Have a Dream' speech.

With the help of rare recordings, he powerfully evokes what it felt like and sounded like to hear Martin speaking--when despondent, indignant, or joyous. Above all, Rieder beautifully captures the spirit of fierce but loving defiance that was key not just to Martin's &#x2018;Letter from Birmingham Jail' but all our efforts to transform America into a vital democracy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ambassador Andrew Young</i></p><p>&#x201c;Eloquent and prophetic.

Beginning with Patrick Kennedy&#39;s arrival in the Brahmin world of Boston in 1848, Maier delves into the deeper currents of the often spectacular Kennedy story, and the ways in which their immigrant background shaped their values-and in turn twentieth-century America-for over five generations. As the first and only Roman Catholic ever elected to high national office in this country, JFK&#39;s pioneering campaign for president rested on a tradition of navigating a cultural divide that began when Joseph Kennedy shed the brogues of the old country in order to get ahead on Wall Street. Whether studied exercise in cultural self-denial or sheer pragmatism, their movements mirror that of countless of other, albeit less storied, American families. But as much as the Kennedys distanced themselves from their religion and ethnic heritage on the public stage, Maier shows how Irish Catholicism informed many of their most well-known political decisions and stances. From their support of civil rights, to Joe Kennedy&#39;s tight relationship with Pope Pius XII and FDR, the impact of their personal family history on the national scene is without question-and makes for an immensely compelling narrative. Bringing together extensive new research in both Ireland and the United States, several exclusive interviews, as well as his own perspective as an Irish-American, Maier&#39;s original approach to the Kennedy era brilliantly illustrates the defining role of the immigrant experience for the country&#39;s foremost political dynasty.</p><p>"Be more Irish than Harvard," inscribed Robert Frost in the book of poetry he gave to John F. Kennedy at the 1961 presidential inauguration. With these simple words, Frost hit upon the experience that defined America's favorite political dynasty for over five generations: their Irish Catholicism. As acclaimed journalist Thomas Maier reveals in <i>The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings</i>, their ethnicity, religion, and cultural background molded the Kennedy family to the core-both bolstering their stunning successes and coloring their spectacular tragedies.<p> Drawing on groundbreaking research both here and abroad, Maier shows how their Irish Catholic immigrant heritage was far more central to the Kennedy experience than they or any previous chroniclers have allowed. John F. Kennedy's historic climb to the White House-as the first and only religious minority ever elected to the American presidency-is only a fraction of this story. </p><p> Beginning with Patrick Kennedy's arrival in the Brahmin world of Boston in 1848, Maier delves into the family saga's deeper personal and emotional currents. He allows us to see family patriarch Joe Kennedy not just as a brilliant American businessman and powermonger, but as a fierce Irish chieftain who suffers loss after tragic loss. And in moving detail, he reveals Jackie Kennedy's thoughts of suicide after her husband's 1963 assassination, as recalled in letters, diaries and an interview with her priest-confessor. </p><p> For the first time, this dramatic work of reportage also lays bare the intricate connections that link the family's most well-known stances and decisions with this storied heritage. From the Kennedy's close relationship with the Vatican, including deal-brokering between FDR and Pope Pius XII, on through the role of American cardinals in the 1960 presidential election, to the family's deep roots in Ireland's struggle for freedom, including Kennedy cousin ties to the old IRA, Maier illuminates once secret negotiations and hitherto unacknowledged loyalties. Casting new light on the Kennedys' struggles with race, anti-Semitism, the sexual mores of the Catholic Church, and even on John F. Kennedy's <i>A Nation of Immigrants</i>, the result is a revelatory glimpse at a remarkable intersection of private beliefs and public politics. </p><p> In crafting this intimate portrait, Maier was granted access to newly available personal papers from the Joseph P. Kennedy archive at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, and several never-before-published photos from the Kennedy Family Collection. His account relies upon on-the-record interviews as well as research in Ireland, at the Vatican, and throughout the United States. Bringing together exclusive comments from Sen. Edward Kennedy, former Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and many others, Thomas Maier tells the story of the Kennedys in an entirely new way-and weaves a spellbinding, uniquely American epic.</p><b>Thomas Maier</b> is a staff reporter at <i>New York Newsday</i> .

Inspirational</p><p>Part melodrama and part parable, Mitch Albom's <i>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</i> weaves together three stories, all told about the same man: 83-year-old Eddie, the head maintenance person at Ruby Point Amusement Park. As the novel opens, readers are told that Eddie, unsuspecting, is only minutes away from death as he goes about his typical business at the park. Albom then traces Eddie's world through his tragic final moments, his funeral, and the ensuing days as friends clean out his apartment and adjust to life without him. In alternating sections, Albom flashes back to Eddie's birthdays, telling his life story as a kind of progress report over candles and cake each year. And in the third and last thread of the novel, Albom follows Eddie into heaven where the maintenance man sequentially encounters five pivotal figures from his life (a la <i>A Christmas Carol</i>). Each person has been waiting for him in heaven, and, as Albom reveals, each life (and death) was woven into Eddie's own in ways he never suspected. Each soul has a story to tell, a secret to reveal, and a lesson to share. Through them Eddie understands the meaning of his own life even as his arrival brings closure to theirs. <p> Albom takes a big risk with the novel; such a story can easily veer into the saccharine and preachy, and this one does in moments. But, for the most part, Albom's telling remains poignant and is occasionally profound. Even with its flaws, <i>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</i> is a small, pure, and simple book that will find good company on a shelf next to <i>It's A Wonderful Life</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><b>Mitch Albom</b> is the author of the #1 international bestseller <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i>.

But Fagan&#x2019;s narrative talent is really more reminiscent of early Camus and that this novel is a debut is near unbelievable.

He won his first of six Hugo Awards for <em>Lord of Light</em>, and soon after produced the first book of his enormously popular <em>Amber</em> series, <em>Nine Princes in Amber.</em> In addition to his Hugos, he went on to win three Nebula Awards over the course of a long and distinguished career. He died on June 14, 1995.</p>This is the ninth book in the popular Amber series; there are ten books and five short stories altogether. Amber is another plane of existence, an alternate universe, first among many, with magic, ghosts, strange creatures, and magical patterns. Zelazny reads in a deep voice so laid-back that he sounds on the verge of sleep. However, it&#39;s oddly effective. D.W. (c) AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p>
